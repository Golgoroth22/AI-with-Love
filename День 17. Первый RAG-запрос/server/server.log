In\nBushido, the fate of the world hangs\nnot on armies but on individual heroes,\npeople of extraordinary capacity,\nattuned to the all-permeating life force\nknown as Ki . This force is the fabric of\nthe Bushido universe, and those with\nthe appropriate training or natural\ntalent can tap into this energy source\nand gain seemingly superhuman\npowers . In the world of Bushido, the\ndelicate tapestry of Ki – and thus the\nuniverse itself – is threatened by the\nforces of imbalance, and it is up to you\nto protect it – or help rip it apart . In\na game of Bushido, nothing less than\nthe fate of the universe is at stake . Are\nyou ready for the challenge of the Way\nof the Warrior?\nBushido is an exciting skirmish game\ndesigned for two players using\nexquisite 32mm miniatures . Take\ncontrol of heroes or villains and clash\nwith others for control of the Isles of\nJwar! They say that the monks record\ntheir histories in scrolls and chanting,\nwhile the samurai write their legacy\nin blood, but in an intense game of\nBushido, how you write your account\nis up to you! You’ll take turns moving\nyour models around the battlefield,\nthen rolling dice to see if your well-\nplanned strategies succeed or fail .\nBushido is not only about intense\nmelee between razor-sharp swords\nand fists, but completing intricate\nScenarios to score objectives and win\nthe game . Strategy and savagery go\nhand-in-hand in a game of Bushido,\nRisen Sun .\nGAME OVERVIEW\n3\nGETTING READY\nFor a game of Bushido, each player will need:\n• A copy of these rules .\n• A set of Bushido miniatures and\ntheir cards .\n• A tape measure or a measuring\n‘Widget’.\n• At least ten six-sided (D6) dice in\ntwo different colours . Five in one\ncolour, and five in another .\n• Several coins, chips, or dice to track\na model’s Ki Tokens during play;\nsome people like to use ten-sided\ndice for this .\n• To protect your cards use plastic\ncard sleeves and a ‘dry wipe’ marker\npen .\n• An area to play on that is at least\n2 foot by 2 foot . Usually, you’ll\nneed a bit more space than this to\naccommodate dice, cards, snacks,\ndrinks, etc .\n• Several bits of terrain . These can\nvary in size, but no single piece\nshould be larger than 9” x 9”.\n• Optionally: Special Attack / Defence\nCards for reference and a Bushido\nToken Set to help track ‘in-game’\nstates and effects .\nGetting Ready\n4 Terms and Concepts\nActivating Model: The model as\nchosen by the Active Player currently\nresolving its action .\nActive Player: The player whose turn\nit is to activate a model .\nBase to Base (BtB): A model is in BtB\nwith another model if their bases are\nphysically touching . An activating\nmodel not in BtB already can only\nenter BtB with 1 Enemy model per\nactivation . Some ranges are specified\nas BtB rather than in inches .\nBattlefield: A game of Bushido takes\nplace on a 2x2’ area we call the\nBattlefield . Models on the Battlefield\nor designated as being Elsewhere (see\nElsewhere) are in play .\nController: The player with whom a\nmodel is currently Friendly .\nCounters: Counters are named for the\neffect that requires them and may be\nused to count turn, activations or some\nother timing effect before they expire .\nActivation Counters are a particular\ntype of counter . These show how\nmany activations a model can make\nthis turn . See Condition (p .28) .\nCover: A model benefits from Cover\nfrom an Enemy model if any straight\nline from the Enemy passes through an\nObscuring or Blocking terrain element\nthat is within 1” of the Target model .\nDamage: A model is Damaged or takes\nDamage when it suffers wounds or its\nwound boxes are marked . Model A\ndeals damage or causes damage when\na model has wound boxes marked due\nto an effect on model A or an action\ntaken by model A .\nDamage Roll: A roll using 2D6, applying\nany negative or positive modifiers\nthen cross-referencing on the Wound\nTable (p .45) in the column equal to\nthe Success Level of the test, to see\nthe number of wounds inflicted on a\nmodel .\nDeploy: When a model is first put into\nplay it is Deployed onto the battlefield.\nAfter Terrain is Set Up, any effects that\nadd more terrain to the battlefield\nmay also say they are deployed .This\nis not a Move or Place .A model may\nnot be Deployed into BtB with an\nEnemy model or in an Enemy Model’s\nZoC (pg .10) .(Terrain instead follows\nthe Terrain Rules and any restrictions\nfor the effect putting terrain into\nplay) . Models are Deployed with no\nActivation Counters .\nTERMS AND CONCEPTS\n5\nDice Rolls: Bushido uses ordinary six-\nsided dice .When a dice is rolled, the\nnumber given is referred to as the\nvalue on the dice . We use dice in the\nfollowing ways:\nD6: The number shown on a single\nsix-sided dice roll\n2D6: Two dice added together to give\na value between 2 and 12\nD3: Roll a D6 . A roll of 1-2=1, 3-4=2,\n5-6=3 .\nD2: Roll a D6 . A roll of 1-3=1, 4-6=2 .\nSome abilities call for a coin flip; this\ncan be represented with a D2 if needed.\nIn some instances a random model or\nother element may need to be selected,\nany straightforward method should\nsuffice; assigning each a number then\nrolling a dice should also work .\nEffects: This is a catch-all term for\nvarious rules including Ki Feats, Theme\nbonuses, Unique Effects, Event Cards\nor others . Usually, for timing we say\n“Effects that happen in this phase” or\nsimilar; this means any rule that says it\nhappens in that phase .\nElsewhere: Elsewhere is a specific\nplace for models in play but not on\nthe Battlefield . These may be Flanking\ntroops, models flying high over the\nbattle or fighting on another plane\nof existence . Models Elsewhere\ngenerate Ki Tokens as usual and are\naffected by traits and states (such as\nRegenerate and On Fire) . They cannot\nhave Activation Counters, and cannot\nspend tokens .\nEnemy/Friendly: Models can either be\nFriendly or Enemy models, depending\non which player’s Warband they are\nin; therefore Models in a player’s ‘own’\nWarband are considered Friendly, while\nModels in an Opponent’s Warband are\nconsidered Enemy models .\nEntering: During any move, the first\ntime a model comes into contact\nwith an area of the battlefield,\nterrain element or named effect it is\nconsidered to Enter that area, terrain\nor effect . If an effect is over multiple\nareas or terrain elements (e .g . Void\nRifts) the model only Enters the effect\nthe first time it contacts the effect . If\na model is Placed into an area of the\nbattlefield, terrain element or named\neffect it is considered to Enter that\narea, terrain or effect .\nExhausted: A model with no Activation\nCounters is considered Exhausted\nFacing: A model’s Facing line is directly\nin the centre of the front of its base . It\nshould be marked with a line or dot on\nthe model’s base. Ninety degrees either\nside of a model’s facing line shows its\nFront Arc and should be marked on the\nmodel’s base with lines or dots .\nA model is Facing anything forward of\nits Front Arc .\nA model is Directly Facing anything in\nfront of its facing line .\nTerms and Concepts\nFacing\nFront Arc\n6\nFaction: Models have a Faction Icon\nto denote which of the many warring\nfactions from the Jwar Isles they\nbelong to; therefore, if a rule references\na Faction, it refers to the Faction Icon\nprinted on the model’s card .\nInitiative: The model with the\nInitiative checks its Attack dice first\nin Melee Exchanges and declares the\nuse of Ki Boosts and Ki Feats after\ntheir Opponent (See Melee Sequence\np .42) . The Activating model has the\nInitiative unless a trait, State or game\neffect changes this .\nIn Play: A model is in play when it is on\nthe Battlefield or Elsewhere .A model\nis not in play when not recruited into\nthe Warband and/or has been Killed or\nremoved from Play .\nKi Boost: A Ki Boost is a special type\nof Ki Feat that increases statistics .\nKilled: When a model has 0 wounds\nremaining on its Wound Track it is\nKilled, remove the model from the\ntable . See Wound Track (p .14) .\nLine of Sight (LoS): A model can\ndraw LoS to points in its Facing . LoS\nis achieved if you can draw a straight\nline from any part of the origin model’s\nBase to a point in that origin model’s\nFacing .Terrain and models block LoS\nexcept for the following:\n• LoS is not blocked by models and\nTerrain elements smaller than the\nmodel LoS is being drawn to .\n• LoS is not blocked by models (other\nthan the model you are drawing LoS\nto) and Terrain elements smaller\nthan the model drawing LoS .\nLoS may be checked for any model\n(Friendly or Enemy) at any time .\nMarkers: Markers are used to mark\nwhat States are currently affecting a\nmodel . See States (p .52) .\nMeasuring Distances: The unit of\nmeasure in Bushido is inches .\n• Movement distances are measured\nfrom the nearest base edge to the\npoint the model wishes to move\nfollowing the route the model’s\nbase will take .\n• Targeting distances are measured\nfrom the nearest base edge of a\nmodel to the nearest base edge of\nthe Target .\n• Measurements, whether distances,\nLoS, or other measurements, may\nbe taken at any time for any reason\nby either player . In timed play, the\nplayer whose clock is running\nalways has priority and should not\nbe obstructed by their opponents’\nmeasuring devices .\nTerms and Concepts\nModel A has no LoS to Model B since\nModels E and D are blocking LoS.\nModel C is Medium Sized, so has LoS to\nModel A, likewise Model A has LoS to\nModel C.\nCb\nA\nD\nE\n7\n• When measuring if a model or\npoint is within a given range\nthen precisely up to that range is\nconsidered within . E .g . if the edge\nof a model’s base is exactly 6”\naway from its Opponent’s base, it is\nconsidered to be within 6”.\n• If a range is given as BtB, then the\nmodel is in range of itself .\nModifiers: When a statistic is modified\nit can never go above double its base\nvalue . If results are divided and leave\nfractions, always round down except in\nthe case of distances, where fractions\nof inches are kept . Numerical values of\ntraits can be modified . See Traits (p .59) .\nIf an effect requires dice to be\nsubstituted, the value of the dice is\noften fixed to some value. It is helpful to\nphysically remove the dice and place it,\nshowing that value, with the dice that\nwere rolled . If a dice is substituted, it\ncannot be re-rolled . If modifiers, rerolls,\nadding or removal of dice affect any roll\nthen only after all of these have been\nresolved can a result be determined .\nMovement: Movement is measured\nusing a tape measure (Or other\nmeasuring devices) . If a model must\nmove Toward another game element\n(such as another model or Terrain\npiece), then it cannot increase its\ndistance from that element for any\npart of its movement . If it must move\nDirectly Toward a game element, then it\ncan only move in a straight line drawn\nfrom the centre of its base to the centre\nof the game element . Similarly, a model\nwhich must moveAwaycannot decrease\nits distance from that element for any\npart of its movement . If it must move\nDirectly Away from a game element,\nthen it can only move in a straight line\ndrawn from the centre of its base away\nfrom the centre of the game element .\nAn activating model can only enter BtB\nwith one Enemy model per activation .\nAlso, see Movement (p .26) .\nOpen and Hidden Information: In\nBushido, all information is ‘open’\nunless explicitly stated otherwise; it\nmeans that both players are entitled\nto read any rules, stats, model cards,\nspecial cards or any other information\npertinent to the game, unless the\nrules explicitly state the information\nis hidden . Each player’s Hidden\nInformation should be recorded on\none sheet of paper and handed over\nafter the game . If you have a third\nparty, they can be used to check secret\ninformation during the game to make\nsure no mistakes happen .\nOwner: A model’s owner is the player\nwho initially recruited the model into\ntheir Warband or summoned the\nmodel, ignoring any control markers\nor game effects .\nTerms and Concepts\n8 Terms and Concepts\nPlace: Sometimes Models are Placed\non the table instead of moving around\nthe table . See Movement (p .27) .\nReplace: When a model is replaced,\nswap the model on the board with the\nnew model .\nIf the model was not in play, the\nnew model is considered Deployed .\nThe player using the replacing effect\nchooses the new model’s facing . If\nthe new model has a different sized\nbase, then it must be placed so that\nthe larger base entirely covers the\narea of the smaller base . If the model\nbeing replaced was in BtB with an\nEnemy model, the new model must be\nplaced in BtB with the Enemy model\nif possible . When 2 models swap\npositions, replace each model with the\nother model .\nReturn to Play:When returning a model\nto play the returning model loses all\nState Markers, Tokens, Counters and\ngame effects . Enhancements remain\nattached as per the Summon rule,\nused Enhancements and Ki Feats will\nremain used if use is limited .Unmark\nall wound boxes, or if a Kami, gain Ki\nTokens equal to maximum Ki .\nSelect: No LoS is needed to select a\nmodel; selecting is not targeting . A\nmodel may ‘select’ itself .\nSize: Unless a model’s Size is stated as\na trait, it is determined by its base .\n• Small Base (30mm) = Small Size\n• Medium Base (40mm) = Medium Size\n• Large Base (50mm) = Large Size\n• Huge Base (60mm) = Huge Size\nTiny and Huge models are indicated by\nTraits . Models with these traits have\nthe given size regardless of base size .\nSummon: When a model is Summoned\nto the game it is added to the warband\nin addition to the models already\nrecruited . You do not need to pay\nthe Rice Cost of a Summoned model .\nSome models have Su as their Rice\nCost, these can only enter play by\nbeing Summoned .\nWhen a non-unique model is\nSummoned to the game it never has\nany Enhancement - Equipment cards\nattached to its card . If a unique model\nthat was recruited into the warband is\nSummoned after being removed from\nthe game, it retains any Enhancement\n- Equipment cards it was recruited\nwith .\nSupporting Dice: When making a\nTest, a maximum of 2 Dice are chosen\nas supporting dice; these each add +1\nto the value of the highest dice roll to\nget the final result .\n9\nSurprised: A model is Surprised if an\nActivating Enemy model that did not\nbegin its activation in BtB, performs an\naction that Targets it or brings it into\nBtB and that Enemy model started\noutside of LoS and remains outside\nof LoS during movement . Surprised\nmodels may not declare Ki Feats or\nKi Boosts, are always the Attacker\nsecond in Melee Exchanges, may\nnot benefit from traits or effects that\naffect Initiative and suffer a -1 Melee\nPool modifier .\nThey may still declare Special Attacks\nand Defences . Models are only\nSurprised until the action in which\nthey became Surprised is resolved .\nEffects which are not Ki Feats may still\nbe used .\nTargeting: A model must be able to\ndraw LoS to another model to Target\nit . A model may always Target itself .\nTest: Whenever a model attempts\nan action which may succeed or\nfail, its controlling player rolls dice\nto complete a Test . The value of the\ndice rolled will determine if the model\nsucceeds or fails the test . See Tests\n(p .32) .\nTiming: Any effect which does not\nspecify when it can be used may be\nused any time The exception is during\nMelee Exchanges or Ranged Attacks\nwhen the timing is restricted as\ndetailed in the Melee Exchanges and\nRanged Attacks section (p .36) .\nKi feats that state “when” they may be\nused can be used only when conditions\nare met . This can allow them to be\nused during melee exchanges and\nranged attacks outside of the window\nnormally allowed by those sections .\nIf both players wish to use such effects\nthe active player goes first .\nIf the trigger for using an effect is\noccurring while information is hidden\nthen the effect may not be used .\nIf an effect does not have a stated\nexpiration time, it ends in the End Phase\nTokens: Tokens are used to track a\nmodel’s resources, such as Ki Tokens .\nTrap: Only one Trap Effect may be\nused per activation . The following are\nconsidered Traps:\n• Animal Trap, Pungi Pit Trap, Rope\nTrap Event Cards\n• Deference and Snare Ki Feats\nOther trap cards released after this\nrulebook will include text identifying\nthem as Traps .\nTerms and Concepts\nExample: The Corruption of Virtue Event\nis used when an opponent uses a Virtue\nToken . If a Virtue Token is used during\na Melee Exchange to add more Special\nAbility options, this is designated\nHidden Information . By the time the\nPlayer discovers the Virtue Token has\nbeen spent, the timing window for\nthe trigger has passed and the Event\ncannot be used .\n10\nVirtue Tokens: Many effects give out\nVirtue Tokens, most commonly the\nVirtue Trait . This particular type of\nToken represents different benefits\ndepending on the other models you\nrecruit . When a Virtue Token is spent\nby the profile which has it, it chooses\none of the available abilities .\nNote: The abilities usually say “This\nmodel…” . This refers to the model\nspending the token since that model\ngains the ability . You read it as if it\nwere reading the spending model’s\nprofile card .\nSome models have abilities that can\nonly be used by spending a Virtue\nToken . When a model spends a Virtue\nToken you may choose one permitted\nability on the card of any Friendly\nmodel in play . Note: Some models\nhave abilities that are restricted to a\ncertain group or even specific models;\nsee individual cards for details .\nExample: Ito Ayako has the Virtue\ntrait . This allows her to give out Virtue\nTokens . Ito Kenzo has a Virtue Token .\nKenzo can spend the Virtue Token any\ntime he would be able to use an Instant\nKi Feat. He declares that he is spending\nthe Virtue Token . He then consults the\nother profiles in his Warband . In this\ncase, Ito Ayako and Kauzhiko are in\nthe same Warband . Consulting both\nprofile cards, Kenzo could gain 1 of the\nfollowing benefits from Ayako’s profile\ncard:\nLooking at Kazuhiko’s card, Kenzo could\ngain one of the following benefits:\nKenzo can choose from any one of these\n5 benefits when he spends his token.\nDeciding that Lightning Reflexes until the\nEnd Phase is what he needs, Kenzo chooses\nthat benefit from Ayako’s card and spends\nthe Virtue Token to gain Lightning Reflexes.\nIf a model without the Bushi descriptor\nspends a Virtue Token the options on\nHokibo’s card are not available to it. It\ncould use the abilities on Naigubu’s\ncard because they only specify “...when a\nFriendly Model spends a Virtue Token...”\nExample: Hokibo has Virtue abilities\nthat read “...when a Bushi model spends a\nVirtue Token…”\nTerms and Concepts\n11\nWarband: A player’s Warband consists\nof recruited, Summoned and Controlled\nmodels as well as Special cards .\nZone of Control (ZoC): In Bushido,\nevery model has a ZoC extending 1”\nfrom the edge of its base to any point\nwithin its LoS .\nModels ignore Friendly ZoCs, but once\na model enters an Enemy model’s ZoC it\nmay only move either directly towards\nthat model, or directly away until it\nleaves the ZoC .\nModels beginning their activations in\none or more Enemy model’s ZoC must\ndo one of the following:\n• Declare a Stand Up action\n• Declare an action that allows them\nto move into BtB with one of those\nmodels and move directly toward\nthe enemy model until they reach\nBtB\n• Declare another action that allows\na move\nThey must move directly away from the\nEnemy model until they leave the ZoC;\nor away from all models until they leave\nall Enemy model’s ZoC if in multiple\nZoCs, after which they can move freely .\nModels can ignore the ZoC of Models\nthat are in BtB with Enemy models for\nmovement and declaring or performing\nactions (such as Ranged Attack Actions\nor Scenario Actions which otherwise\ncannot be performed in a ZoC) .\nIf a model moves out of BtB, then it\nmay ignore the ZoC until that move is\ncompleted .\nZone of Control\nTerms and Concepts\n12\nPROFILE CARDS\nProfile cards contain all the rules\nspecific to all models represented by\nthat card . You may also use the profile\ncard to keep track of the wounds\nsustained by your model(s), Ki Tokens\nand game effects .\n1 . Name: The name of the model(s) .\nIf this card represents a unique\nindividual character rather than one\nor more generic profiles, this has a\nspecial border, and the Rice Cost is\ncoloured Gold .\n2 . Elemental Icons: Some models are\naspected towards one or more of the\nsix elements:\nEarth Water\nFire Metal\nAir Void\n3 . Base Size & Max Symbol: If a profile\nhas multiple base size symbols any of\nthe available options are permitted .\nProfile Cards without wound tracks\nhave a MAX symbol on the back .\nWhenever a rule refers to the number\nof wound tracks use the MAX\nnumber instead . You can recruit up\nto this number of these models into a\nwarband .\n4 . Type: The type indicates all the\nkeywords that refer to the model . A\nmodel can have multiple types, these\nare separated by commas, and a model\nis always all of its types .\nThe Name and Types of models can\noften be referred to by other rules .\nTraits often have a [Type] that singles\nout what models the trait affects . This\n[Type] can also be a model’s name .\nPlural words are considered the same\ntype as the same singular word for\ncards with multiple wound tracks .\nCARDS\nCards\n1\n2\n6\n7\n10 12\n8\n9\n4\n5a 5b\n5c 5d\n11\n3\n13\n5 . Statistics: The number is the\nmodel’s base statistic value . Some\neffects modify a statistic, but it can\nnever go above double its base value .\nIf a statistic is 0, it can be modified to\na maximum of 1 .\nIf a “-” icon represents a statistic, then\nit counts as 0 but cannot be modified\nby positive or negative modifiers .\nSome models may have a Ki boost\nicon to the side of the Statistic value .\nThis is the Statistic’s Boost cost .This\nis the cost in Ki Tokens to increase\nthe Statistic by 1 .Boosts remain only\nfor the current Test or Movement . A\nplayer may increase a Statistic multiple\ntimes (to a maximum of double its\nbase Statistic), as long as there are\nKi Tokens available to do so . Boosts\nare considered Ki Feats . See Ki Feats\n(p .56) .\na) Melee Pool Statistic: This is the\nnumber of dice the model uses\nwhen resolving an Opposed Melee\ntest .\nb) Ranged Pool Statistic: This is the\nnumber of dice the model uses\nwhen resolving a Ranged Attack .\nNote: Many models will have some Ranged\npool statistic even if they do not have\na ranged weapon. Perhaps they can be\nbought a ranged weapon or use the ability\nin some other way.\nc) Move Statistic: The distance the\nmodel can move in inches when it\nmakes a movement that specifies\nthis distance . Also, the number of\ndice rolled for a Move Test .\nCards\nExample: Aiko; Unsui, Monk, Shugenja is a\nTemple of Ro-Kan model.\nThe Silverback’s trait Bodyguard[Aiko](3”)\nworks on her because her name is Aiko.\nAn Enemy Kyuubi would gain the bonus for\nVengeance because she is a Shugenja.\nShe can be included in the Righteous Warriors\ntheme because she is a Monk.\nIn addition, she is Unsui and so not a model\naffected by Ume’s Mentor rule.\nExample: Both Kintaru and Fishermen of\nthe Ro-Kan are Fisherman models. Kintaru,\nbecause he has it in his type, Fisherman of the\nRo-Kan because it’s in the name.\nTYPES\n14\nd) Ki Statistic/Maximum Ki Limit: The\nKi statistic is actually 2 statistics\nrepresented by 2 numbers written\nX/Y . The X number is the model’s\nKi statistic . This tells you the\namount of Ki Tokens each model\nrepresented by this card generates\nduring the Starting Phase and the\nnumber of dice it uses for Opposed\nand Challenge Ki tests .\nThe second Y number is the model’s\nKi Limit, the maximum number of Ki\nTokens each model represented by\nthis card can have at any one time .\nIf it would gain more than this, any\nexcess is discarded .\n6 . Wounds Track: The number of\nwounds a model can suffer . When\na model suffers wounds an equal\namount are marked from its Wound\nTrack .When a model is reduced to 0\nwounds remaining on its Wound Track\nit is Killed; remove the model from the\ntable . When a model Heals wounds,\nit recovers marked wounds from its\nWound Track . A model cannot Heal\nmore than it has marked wounds .\nSome cards have multiple Wound\nTracks to use for multiple identical\nmodels . The number of Wound Tracks\nis the limit to how many of these\nmodels you may recruit or Summon\ninto a Warband, either at Warband\nCreation or during the game .\nSome Profile Cards, such as Kami\nmodels, have a Max symbol on the\nback next to their Size . These Profile\ncards are usually ones that have no\nwound tracks . Whenever a rule refers\nto the number of Wound Tracks use\nthe Max number instead if the card has\none . You can recruit up to this number\nof these models into a Warband .\n7. Traits:Each model may have several traits\nthat describe how it behaves in the game .\nThis makes those traits easier to find when\nyou need them . Some traits are Weapon\nTraits; these are listed on the model’s\nweapon grid and are only in effect when\nusing that weapon . See Traits (p .59) .\n8 . Ki Feats: Ki Feats available to the\nmodel(s) . See Ki Feats (p .56) .\n9 . Melee and Ranged Weapon Grids:\nAll models in Bushido have a melee\nweapon, though for many they are fists\nand feet or claws and teeth . Some also\nhave a ranged weapon. The weapon grid\nalso lists any weapon traits that are in\neffect when using that weapon, as well\nas any special attacks and defences that\nare available when using that weapon:\na) Designates the weapon as either a\nMelee or Ranged Attack weapon .\nRanged Weapons have Range Bands.\n• Short Range (first value):\nRanged Attacks against Targets\nup to and including this distance\nare at Short Range .\n• Medium Range (second value):\nRanged Attacks against Targets\nbeyond Short Range and up to and\nincluding this distance are at\nMedium Range .\n• Long Range (third value):\nRanged Attacks against Targets\nbeyond Medium Range and up to\nand including this distance are\nat Long Range .\na\nb\nc\nd\nc\nb\na\nCards\n15\n• Ranged Attacks against Targets at\ndistances exceeding the weapon’s\nLong Range automatically fail .\nb) A weapon’s Strength modifier to\nany Damage Rolls made by this\nweapon . (Sp) Indicates a special\neffect instead of a standard damage\nroll The attack does no damage,\nsome of these weapons have\nproperties detailed in the Unique\nEffects section of the model’s\nprofile card .\nc) Any Traits associated with the\nweapon .\nd) Any Special Attacks and Defences\navailable when using that weapon .\n10 . Faction symbol: Which Faction the\nmodel belongs to . Some models are\nfrom the Ronin Faction . Your Warband\ncan only recruit models that belong to\nyour chosen Faction or Ronin models\nrecruitable by your chosen faction as\nindicated on the Ronin model’s card .\nSee Ronin (p .22) .\n11 . Unique Effects: Any additional rules\nthat are not Traits or Feats .\n11a. Traits Reminder Text: Starter set\ncards have reminder text for all their traits.\nRemember this is just a reminder of the\nrule; the full version is in this rulebook,\nalways look up the complete rules text if\nthere is an issue mid game for clarification.\n12 . Rice Cost: The cost to recruit this\nmodel into your Warband .\nModels with Su are Summoned models\nthat enter play during the game\nthrough a Ki Feat or Unique Effect and\ncannot be recruited when creating\nyour Warband .\nModels with Sp are models with a\nspecial rule which will be explained on\nits profile card and cannot be recruited\nwhen creating your Warband .\nIf a card’s Rice Cost is followed with ea,\nthen more than one model represented\nby that card may be recruited into\nyour Warband . Each model recruited\npays the cost specified . If a model’s\nRice Cost is increased or decreased by\na Theme list or other rule, the original\nprinted Rice Cost is still used for all\ngame effects relying on the Model’s\nRice Cost .\nCards\n16\nSPECIAL CARDS\nFaction decks include special cards\nspecific to each faction, with a Ronin\nset of special cards available to all .\nEach card can be recruited X times per\nWarband based on its Max (X) trait . If\na card has no printed Max (X) trait, it\nis assumed to be Max (1) .\nThere are three types of Special cards\nthat players can recruit when creating\ntheir Warband - Enhancements,\nEvents, and Terrain . Each type acts\ndifferently in how and what they affect\nduring the game . These are explained\nin detail below, but all special cards are\ncomprised of the following features:\n1 . Name: The card’s name .\n2 . Faction: Special cards may only\nbe purchased if they have the same\nFaction symbol as the Warband, or the\nRonin Faction symbol .\n3 . Type: This specifies if it is an Event,\nEnhancement or Terrain card .\n4 . Description: Describes the card’s\neffects .\n5. Traits: Traits that apply to that card .\n6 . Rice Cost: The cost to recruit the\ncard for the Warband . If the cost is\nvariable its X value is chosen and\nlocked at Warband Creation . Costs\ncannot be modified below 1 Rice .\nSome cards say to Discard the card\nafter a specific trigger happens . A\nDiscarded Special card has no effect\non the game from that point onward .\nENHANCEMENT CARDS\nThe player must decide which\nprofile card an Enhancement card is\nAttached to during the creation of\ntheir Warband . During play, place an\nAttached Enhancement card under the\nchosen profile card . The model(s) will\nbenefit from the effects detailed on\nthe card for as long as it is Attached to\nthe model(s)’ profile card .\nModels with the Insignificant trait\ncannot have Enhancement cards\nAttached to their profile cards during\nWarband creation .Animal, Construct,\nKami and Swarm models may only have\nEnhancement cards that specifically\nname them as Required .\nSome models have multiple profile\ncards . If a card says X and Y are\nconsidered the same model when\ncreating a Warband, then any\nEnhancement cards bought for either\ncard are moved to the one starting in\nplay before the game .\nCards\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n17\nSome cards represent multiple models\nand have multiple wound tracks .\nEnhancement cards will specify if\nthey can be bought for such models\nmultiple times or can only be bought\nfor a single model on the card . In the\ncase of enhancements applied to a\nsingle model on a card representing\nmultiple models, the enhanced\nmodel must be distinguishable from\notherwise identical models without\nthe enhancement .\nEnhancement Card Traits:\nEquipment: This represents a physical\nitem . A model may have only one\nEquipment card attached to it .\nMax (X): This card can be purchased\nfor a Warband up to X times .\nRequirement [Type]: This card can\nonly be Attached to this type of model.\nExclusion [Type]: This card cannot be\nAttached to this type of model .\nEVENT CARDS\nEvent cards are played once, at a time\ndetailed on the card . Once the card\nis resolved, then it is discarded and\nremoved from the game .\nUnless stated otherwise Event Cards\nare used in the same way as Instant\nKi Feats (p .56) . They are not, however,\nconsidered to be Ki Feats .\nSome event cards may result in\nanother special card being put into\nplay, often as a result of some action\non the table . In these cases, the other\nspecial card will be printed on the\nreverse side of the Event card and can\nonly be recruited in this way .\nEvent Card Traits:\nMax (X): This card can be purchased\nfor a Warband up to X times .\nRequirement [Type]: This card is\nrestricted in how it can be played or\nrecruited and requires a [Type] of\nmodel or specifies another restriction .\nCards\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n18\nTERRAIN CARDS\nTerrain cards allow a player to deploy\na specified Terrain element on the\ntable during the player’s normal\nDeployment of their Warband . Terrain\nelements deployed due to Terrain\ncards must follow standard rules for\nTerrain element deployment unless\nstated on the card .\nIf restrictions mean that the terrain\ncannot be deployed, the opposing\nplayer must make as small an alteration\nas possible to allow the bought terrain\nto be placed .\nTerrain Card Traits:\nDestructible: model in base contact\nwith this terrain and not in an enemy\nmodel’s ZoC can declare a Wait Action\nto remove it from the Battlefield .\nModels that are Aloof, Animal,\nInsignificant or have a Max Ki Limit of\n0 cannot perform this effect . This will\nnot trigger effects listed on Friendly\nterrain .\nMax (X): This card can be purchased\nfor a Warband up to X times .\nRequirement [Type]: This card is\nrestricted in how it can be played or\nrecruited and requires a [Type] model .\nFor Passage, Visibility and Size traits\nSee Terrain (p .74) .\nCOMMUNAL CARDS\nSome factions have access to a\nCommunal Card . These cost no Rice\nand can always be recruited . You may\nonly recruit one Communal Card with\nthe same name .\nExample: A warband has recruited\nBakemono Horde “Out of the Underworld”\nso it may not recruit the Bakemono Horde\n“The Shadow Council” communal card.\nSome Communal Cards are used to\npool together all the Ki generated by\ntheir community profiles . If this is the\ncase, all community profiles will have\na maximum Ki listed as * .\nSuch models never have Ki, effects that\nwould gain them Ki, including Channel,\nLeech, Ki Generation, the Focus Action\nor any Ki Feats or other effects instead\nadd Ki to the communal card .\nCommunity Profiles with a * for\nmaximum Ki are not subject to abilities\nthat remove Ki from them. For example\nthey cannot be Leeched from and the\nPsychic Drain Ki Feat has no effect .\nSome Communal Cards may grant\nother abilities, similar to Unique Effects\non a profile card . Some Communal\nCards add new feats to the community\nprofiles . Always read these as if they\nwere printed on the profile card .\nCards\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n19\nTHEME LIST CARDS\nA player can only use one Theme\nper Warband . Themed lists allow you\nto trade restrictions in Warband\ncomposition for other bonuses during\ngameplay . Unless otherwise stated,\nThemes’ benefits only affect Friendly\nmodels .\nTheme Card Traits:\nPermitted (Type): Only models with\na matching type can be recruited\ninto this Warband, Ronin models of\nthe type may only be included if the\ntheme states Ronin of that type are\npermitted .\nIf a Theme list card does not have\nthis trait, all models from the chosen\nFaction are available to recruit into the\ntheme .\nIf a Ronin Theme list card does not\nhave this trait, all models from the\nchosen Faction and all Ronin available\nto that Faction are available to recruit\ninto the theme .\nExclusion (Type): Models with a\nmatching type cannot be recruited\ninto this Warband .\nIf a profile qualifies for both the\nPermitted and Exclusion of a theme,\nthe Exclusion takes priority, and the\nmodel may not be recruited .\nSome models or special cards, when\nrecruited into a Warband, permit other\nmodels to be recruited . Other models\nmay require a specific model to be\nrecruited into the Warband before they\ncan be included. If a model is permitted\nin a Theme then any model it allows\nto be recruited is also allowed in the\ntheme regardless of any Exclusion .\nIf a model or special card is permitted\nin a theme list, any model summoned\nby that model is also allowed to be\nsummoned .\nTheme Benefits:Unless otherwise\nstated, Theme benefits only affect\nFriendly models .\nCards\nExample: Aiko is recruited into the\nRighteous Warriors Theme, Silverback\ncan now be recruited even though\nanimals, gorillas and Silverback are not\nlisted in the Permitted models.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n20\nThis section covers the rules of the game.\nRULE #1: RULES CONFLICTS\nWhen two rules come into direct\nconflict, use the following order of\nprecedence to determine how to\nproceed:\n1 . If one rule (Rule A) references\nanother rule (Rule B) by name, then\nRule A takes priority. If this does not\nresolve the conflict, then move on\nto step 2 below .\n2 .Rules that prevent something\nhappening take priority over rules\nthat force something to happen . If\nthis does not resolve the conflict,\nthen move on to step 3 below .\n3 . If multiple effects happen at the\nsame time:\na . If both Effects belong to the same\nplayer, that player determines the\norder they are resolved .\nb . If the Effects belong to different\nplayers, the Active Player chooses\nthe order to resolve them .\nThe Rules\nTHE RULES\nExample: Kenko uses Slam Attack\non Manu . Manu has the Immovable\nTrait. SlamAttack makes no reference\nto Immovable, & vice versa - so\ntest 1 does not resolve this .As per\ntest 2, since Immovable is stopping\nan effect from happening, it takes\npriority over the Slam rules so Manu\nis not moved or made Prone .\n21\nWARBAND COMPOSITION\nTo recruit a Warband, players must\nchoose a Rice Limit and a Faction to play.\nThe Rice Limit determines the size\nof the game and can be arbitrarily\nchosen . While you can play games\nwith any amount of Rice you will find\nthe following standard formats:\n• 70 rice, Introductory level suggested\nfor quicker games .\n• 100 rice, Standard game format and\nsuggested level for events .\nA Warband may not be of the Ronin\nFaction. A player’s Warband in Bushido\nis made up of several models, and any\nSpecial cards from the same Faction\nand may include Ronin that may be\nrecruited by that Faction .\nThe Rice Cost of your Warband must\ncome to the total agreed upon with\nyour Opponent. A Player can only recruit\none of each card; this does not prohibit\nthe Opponent from recruiting the card\nfor their Warband . Sometimes two or\nmore models are represented by the\nsame profile card . A player can choose\nto recruit as many models as there are\nWound tracks, or up to the Max value,\non the matching profile card .\nSome models are represented by more\nthan one model and profile card . Such\nmodels are considered to be the same\nmodel when creating a Warband .\nStart the game using the model and\nprofile card with a rice cost . Deploy\nthat model unless the profile allows\nthe option to select which model to\ndeploy . Other profile cards and models\nrelating to the same model are not in play\nuntil an effect allows them to replace a\nmodel in play or enter elsewhere .\nUnless otherwise stated, if one such\nmodel is replaced with another,\ntransfer all State Markers, Tokens,\nCounters, Enhancements and game\neffects to the newly deployed model in\nplay on the battlefield deployed using\nthe Replace rules . Mark or unmark\nwound boxes on the new profile,\nor as otherwise directed, to match\nthe replaced model’s marked wound\nboxes . If the replace was the result of\na Ki Feat that ends in the end phase,\nthis replace will not expire in the end\nphase unless noted on the profile card.\nWarband Composition\n22\nIf models are replaced within an\nAction, this replacement will resolve\nthe removed model’s part of the\nAction, then complete the remaining\nAction steps with the new model and\nprofile . Remove an Activation Counter\nfrom the new model following the\nAction steps, if required, to resolve the\ndeclared Action .\nOnly one profile card will have a Rice\nCost . If needed during a game, use\nthe unadjusted Rice Cost printed on\nwhichever profile card has a Rice Cost .\nIf your models are considered to be\nthe same model when recruiting a\nWarband, then, if chosen as VIM, those\nmodels are all considered to be VIM .\nExample: Kota’s Human Form is chosen\nas a VIM . If she is replaced with her\nFox Form, then Kota’s Fox Form is still\nthe VIM .\nRONIN MODELS\nRonin represent wanderers,\nmercenaries, diplomats, outcasts\nand other individuals who may fight\nfor more than one Faction . From\nthree Imperial Princesses expecting\nhospitality from the Tengu to Sojobo\nleaving his people without a King to\nseek the enlightenment of the Temple .\nRonin each have different motivations\nfor working with many Factions, but\nall follow these rules .\na) Ronin models can be included\nin Warbands of multiple different\nfactions . Ronin models may be\nrecruited into any Warband of a\nfaction that is listed on the Ronin card\neither by faction symbol or in words .\nb) Ronin are NOT considered to be of\nthe faction of the Warband they\nare recruited into for game effects .\nIf an effect specifies it works only\non Faction models, then it does not\nwork on Ronin .\nc) Ronin can only have Ronin\nEnhancement cards and cannot be\nincluded in any Faction theme lists\nunless the theme specifies Ronin of\nthat type .\nd) Ronin can be included in Ronin\nTheme Lists .\ne) It is permissible to make a list\nfor a given faction that includes\nonly Ronin models that work for\nthat Faction, but when creating a\nWarband, you cannot choose Ronin\nas your Faction .\nExample: A Prefecture list using the Blood of\nthe Dragon theme can include Samurai but\ncannot include Golden Sentinel models as\nthe theme does not include Ronin Samurai.\nExample: It is possible to create a Warband\nentirely made of Ronin. First choose a\nfaction (Prefecture, Ito, etc…) and choose\nRonin available to that faction. It is not a\n“Ronin Faction” list as this is not permitted.\nWarband Composition\n23\nGAME SETUP\nBefore starting the first Turn, players need to set up the game using the following\nsteps:\n1 . First, each player should create\na Warband . See Warband\nComposition (p .21) .\n2 . Then either agree on or randomly\ndecide, a Scenario to play . See\nScenarios (p .77) .\n3 .Players deploy/nominate any\nScenario Objectives as instructed\nby the Scenario .\n4 .Players deploy Terrain and then\nselect Deployment Zones . See\nTerrain (p .74) .\nWhen deploying Terrain elements,\nfollow these three steps:\na .Players should make a\nDeployment Tactical Test; the\nwinner decides which player is\nPlayer 1 . Player 1 sets up a terrain\nelement first .\nb P. layers alternate in choosing\nTerrain elements until at least six\nelements are deployed . You may\ncontinue adding more terrain\nelements after this, but if one\nplayer chooses to stop, the other\nmay only deploy one final terrain\npiece .\nc . The player who chose to stop\nplacing terrain then chooses\none of the Deployment Zones as\ndictated by the scenario .\n• No Impassable Terrain element\nmay be deployed within a\nScenario or Deployment Zone .\n• No Impassable Terrain element\nmay be deployed within 2” of a\nScenario Objective or another\nTerrain element with the\nImpassable trait .\n5 .The Winner of the Deployment\nTactical Test deploys terrain that is\npart of their Warband first, followed\nby the second player deploying\nterrain from their Warband .\n6 . Players simultaneously Declare or\nRecord any VIMs . See Scenarios\n(p .77) .\n7 . Player 1 then decides which player\ndeploys first; that player then\ndeploys their entire force as detailed\nby the scenario . The second player\nthen deploys their entire force as\ndetailed by the scenario . See the\nScout and Flank traits for deployment\nexceptions (p .70, p .65) .\n8 . The First Turn then begins .\nGAME SETUP & TURN\nGame Setup & Turn\n24\nA GAME TURN\nGames of Bushido are broken down into a number of Turns . How many Turns the\ngame lasts is dictated by the Scenario being played .\nEach game Turn is divided into three Phases . The three Phases are the Starting\nPhase, the Main Phase and the End Phase .\nSTARTING PHASE\n1 . Tactical Test: Resolve the Tactical\nTest . The successful Player chooses\nwho is Active for the Starting and\nEnd Phases this turn, and Active\nPlayer first in the Main Phase .\n2 . Non-Active Player rolls for Variable\nTurns . See Scenarios (p .77) .\n3 . Ki Generation: All models generate\na number of Ki Tokens equal to the\nfirst number of their Ki Statistic .\n4 .All models gain 2 Activation\nCounters each .\n5 . Resolve any effects which happen\n“In the Starting Phase”. The Active\nPlayer resolves their Starting\nPhase effects first in the order they\nchoose . Then the non-Active player\nresolves their Starting Phase Effects\nin the order the non-Active Player\nchooses .\n6 .Players calculate the number of\nPass Tokens for the Turn . Each\nplayer totals the number of models\nin their Warband . The player with\nthe least gains the difference in\nPass Tokens .\nMAIN PHASE\n1 . Starting with the Player chosen to\ngo first via the Tactical roll .\n2 . The player becomes the Active\nPlayer .\n• From this point, the Active Player\nmay use Active Feats .\n3 . The Active Player chooses a model\nin their Warband and declares a\nSimple or Complex action for it to\nperform .\nAlternatively, the player may spend\na Pass Token instead of taking an\naction with one of their models, if\nthey do, skip to step 5 . Players must\nactivate a model if they have models\nwith activation counters available\nunless they spend a pass token .\n4 . The model’s action is resolved .\n5 . The Active player may use Active\nFeats for the last time this\nactivation .\n6 . The Opponent then becomes the\nActive Player and follows from\nStep 2 . If the Opponent is unable\nto activate any models, then the\ncurrent player continues to be the\nActive Player until they are also\nunable to activate any models .\n7 . Once neither player can activate a\nmodel, move to the End Phase .\nGame Setup & Turn\nIf at any point in the Main Phase either\nplayer has no models left in play,\nimmediately move to the End Phase .\n25\nEND PHASE\n1 . Resolve any effects that occur in\nthe End Phase (Other than those\nexpressly stated to resolve in\nanother step) . Always resolve the\nadverse effects first .\n2 . Resolve states that cause Damage\nin the End Phase (Fire, Bleeding,\nPoison) .\n3 . Effects that expire in the End Phase\nnow expire .\n4 . Refer to the Scenario being played\nand check for the scoring of\nScenario Points and then Victory\nPoints. If this is the final Turn, or if all\navailable Victory Points have been\nscored, the game ends (games can\nonly end in the End Phase) .\nIf either player has no models left\nin play, the game ends, and Victory\nPoints are calculated immediately .\n5 . Discard any unspent Pass Tokens .\nGame Setup & Turn\n26\nMOVEMENT & PLACING\nMovement & Placing\nThe model moves up to the given\ndistance, along any path, subject to\nthe restrictions for the action or ability\nthat permits a move and may change\nits Facing at the end of the movement .\nChanging Facing is considered a\nmovement, even if the model remains\nin the same place . During this\nmovement, the model’s base may not\npass through another model’s base or\nimpassable terrain . If an effect allows\na player to move an opponent’s model,\nits facing may not be changed unless\nthe effect specifically states otherwise.\nThe model may make a move up to the\ndistance stated (If no distance is given,\nthe walk is up to the model’s Move\nStatistic in inches) in any direction .\nA model performing a Walk may not\nmove into an Enemy ZoC or move into\nor out of BtB with an Enemy model . If\nan effect allows a player to walk an\nopponent’s model, that player chooses\nits facing at the end of the walk .\nMOVE\nWALK\nModels can move around the board in a number of ways depending on the action\nchosen when the model activates or the effects applied to those models . Some\nmodels are naturally faster than others, represented by their Move statistic and\nMove Boost; many models also have abilities or Ki Feats which allow them to move.\nAny model may use different types of movement by choosing the requisite action;\nsome effects also allow movement; the effect will tell you how the model moves .\nEffects that are triggered by movement can trigger from any of these .\nIf a model would be moved past the edge of the game area, then it stops when its\nbase touches the edge of the board . A model cannot be Placed with any part of its\nbase off the board edge .\nThe model may choose a point within\nits LoS then rotate to face that\npoint . The model may then make a\nmovement in a straight line, directly\ntowards that point . A model may not\nRun into an Enemy model’s ZoC, into\nBtB with an Enemy model, or change\nits Facing after the movement .\nPlacing a model is not considered\nMovement. Just pick up the model and\nplace it in its new permitted location .\nIt does not have a move path, and\nit ignores ZoC, models and terrain\nbetween it, and its final location .\nIf a model is Placed, it cannot be\nplaced into the area of an Impassable\nTerrain Element, another model or\ninto BtB with an Enemy model . Each\nspecific Place effect may have further\nrestrictions . The player Placing the\nmodel decides the model’s Facing .\nThe model Targets an Enemy model,\nmoving up to double its Move Statistic\ntowards that model in a straight\nline which would bring its base into\ncontact with the Target’s base or ZoC .\nDuring this movement, it may not\ncontact an enemy ZoC other than the\nTarget’s. If this movement would cause\nit to contact another Enemy model’s\nZoC, its movement stops immediately\nbefore that ZoC . Once in contact with\nthe Targeted model’s ZoC or if the\ntargeted model is in the acting model’s\nZoC, the charging model may ignore\nthe ZoC of other Enemy models .\nOnce the charging model contacts the\nTarget model’s ZoC, it must move directly\ntowards the target until it is in BtB .\nThis movement need not be along the\nstraight path of the charge movement .\nRUN\nPLACE\nCHARGE\n28\nModels in Bushido perform actions to\naffect the game . The actions a model\ncan take depend on the number of\nActivation counters on that model and\nwhether it’s in BtB with an Enemy model.\nIf a model cannot legally declare\nany actions (due to states, traits or\nother game effects) when chosen\nto activate the model immediately\nbecomes exhausted .\nModels in BtB with an Enemy model\nmay not declare Actions or Ki Feats\nwith the icon . See Ki Feats (p .56) .\nIf a model performs an action with\nthe icon then it may not perform a\nwalk alongside the action .\nThe Active Player chooses which model\nthey are activating (the Activating\nModel) and what Simple or Complex\naction the model will take .\nDuring a model’s action in which the\ndeclared action becomes invalid or\nimpossible to complete, it instead\nreverts to the position it was in when it\ndeclared the action . It then removes one\nActivation Counter, even if the declared\naction was Complex . The activation is\nthen considered to be complete .\nCONDITION\nDuring the Starting Phase, each model\ngains 2 Activation Counters . Each time\na player becomes the active player,\nthey choose one model with activation\ncounters to perform an action . Once\na simple action is completed, remove\n1 Activation Counter . Once a complex\naction is completed remove 2 Activation\nCounters . If a model participates in\na Melee exchange has Activation\nCounters, it loses 1 Activation Counter\nfor participating in the Melee Exchange\nin addition to the Activating model who\nperforms the Melee action .\nIf an effect says a model makes an\nAction, such as a Walk Action or\nother Standard Action, even as part\nof a larger effect or another model’s\nactivation, it loses an Activation\nCounter . If the effect allows the model\nto Walk, Melee or other effect but\ndoes not make an Action, then it does\nnot lose an Activation Counter .\nActions\nACTIONS\nExample: Hanso uses\nhis “Move it!” Ki Feat\non two Yarimen. Both\nYarimen make a Walk\nup to their Move Stat\nin inches, but this is\nnot a Walk Action, so\nthey do not lose an\nActivation Counter.\nExample: Hanso uses his Command trait\non 2 Yarimen. Both Yarimen declare a melee\naction. As Command specifies a Simple\nAction, the Yarimen lose an Activation\nCounter each.\n29\nA model with no Activation counters\nis Exhausted and cannot be chosen to\nactivate. If a model has only one Activation\ncounter, it cannot declare a complex action.\nExhausted models cannot be chosen to\nactivate, but can still participate in Melee\nExchanges .\nSIMPLE ACTIONS\nMelee Action: Select an enemy model .\nThe Activating model must attempt\nto enter BtB with the Enemy model\nby moving up to its Move Statistic\nin inches . During this movement, it\nmay only enter into the ZoC of the\nmodel with whom it is attempting to\nenter BtB . However, while within that\nmodel’s ZoC or if the selected model\nis in the acting model’s ZoC it may\nignore other Enemy models’ Zones of\nControl .\nIf at the end of its movement, it is in\nBtB with the selected Enemy model, it\nmust resolve a Melee Exchange .\nModels that start their activation\nin BtB with a single Enemy model\nmay only move around that Enemy\nmodel’s base, ignoring the ZoC of\nenemy models . They may enter BtB\nwith a different chosen model as part\nof this move . After moving a Melee\nExchange is resolved with the chosen\nmodel in BtB .\nModels that start their activation in\nBtB with a single Enemy model may\nonly move around that Enemy model’s\nbase, ignoring the ZoC of enemy\nmodels . They may enter BtB with a\ndifferent selected model as part of this\nmove . This movement is not limited\nby the model’s Move Statistic . After\nmoving, a Melee Exchange is resolved\nwith the selected model in BtB .\nSTANDARD ACTIONS\nStandard actions in the game fall into two categories - Simple or Complex . Simple\nActions remove one Activation Counter, while Complex Actions remove two\nActivation Counters . Traits and Unique effects may grant other actions, but they\nare not considered Standard actions .\nNESTED ACTIVATIONS\nEffects such as Pack and Group Traits\nor use of the Command Action allows\nmultiple models to activate at once . It\nis not permitted for models activated\nusing such effects to then also use\nthose effects .\nActions\nExample: Tsuki uses her Pack trait on\nGorak and Kite . Gorak may not use\nhis Pack Trait to also activate Muna .\nNote you only remove one activation\ncounter from a model for declaring a\nmelee action and being involved in\nthe resulting melee exchange .\n30\nDisengage Action: Choose one enemy\nmodel in BtB with the activating\nmodel .The activating model resolves\na Melee Exchange against that model .\nIt must allocate at least as many\ndice to Defence as to Attack, and if\nunable to do this (E .g . the model is\nAggressive) then it may not attempt\na Disengage Action . If the Activating\nmodel successfully defends or ends\nthe exchange, not in BtB with the\nchosen model, after the Melee is\nresolved, it may make a Walk up to its\nMove Statistic in inches, ignoring all\nmodels in BtB .\nSimple Ki Feat Action: The Activating\nmodel may attempt a Simple Ki Feat\nlisted on its profile card . Some Ki Feats\nhave the or Icons; these icons\napply to this action if the chosen Ki\nFeat has them .\nRanged Attack Action: The\nActivating model makes a Ranged\nAttack , targeting an Enemy model (see\nRanged Attack, p .36) and may make a\nWalk up to its move in inches either\nbefore or after the Ranged Attack is\nresolved; you must declare whether\nyou will walk as part of declaring the\naction . The model cannot make a\nRanged Attack while in BtB or within\nthe ZoC of an Enemy model . A model\nmaking a Ranged Attack may be\nreferred to as “The Attacker”.\nRun Action: The model may make\na Run up to 1 .5 x its Move Statistic in\ninches . See Movement (p .26) .\nSimple Scenario Action: The\nmodel may not be in BtB with an\nEnemy model, or in an Enemy’s ZoC,\nand must be in BtB with a Scenario\nObjective . Turn the Activating model\nto face the objective directly . See the\nspecific Scenario to resolve any other\neffects of the Action .\nStand Up Action: This action may\nonly be declared if the Activating\nmodel is Prone . The model removes its\nProne State marker and may change\nits Facing . After removing the marker,\nif the model is in BtB with an Enemy\nmodel, then resolve a Melee Exchange\nwith a -1 Melee Pool penalty .\nActions\n31\nWait Action: The Activating\nmodel takes no other action . Instead,\nit may choose one of the listed effects\ntriggered by taking the Wait Action .\n• Remove all Stunned Markers\n• Remove all Immobilised Markers\n• Remove up to 2 Fire Markers\n• Remove a Reload Marker\n• An effect triggered by a Wait action,\nspecified on the model’s card or a\nspecial card .\n• Remove a piece of Destructible\nTerrain which the activating model\nis in BtB contact with from the\ntable. Models that are Aloof, Animal,\nInsignificant or have a Maximum\nKi Limit of 0 cannot perform this\neffect . This will not trigger effects\nlisted on Friendly terrain .\nWalk Action: The Activating\nmodel may make a Walk up to its\nMovement Statistic in inches . See\nMovement (p .26) .\nCOMPLEX ACTIONS\nCharge Action: The Activating\nmodel makes a Charge move . See\nMovement (p .26) .\nIf a model does not have enough\nmovement to achieve BtB with its\nTarget, then it cannot declare a charge\naction on that target . After moving\ninto BtB, a Melee Exchange is resolved.\nFor this Melee Exchange, the charging\nmodel gains +2 to its first Damage Roll.\nComplex Ki Feat Action: The Activating\nmodel may attempt a Complex Ki feat\nlisted on its profile card . Some Ki Feats\nhave the or Icons; these icons\napply to this action if the chosen Ki\nFeat has them .\nFocus Action: The Activating\nmodel gains the number of Ki Tokens\nequal to its Ki Statistic .\nComplex Scenario Action:\nThe model may not be in BtB with an\nEnemy model or in an Enemy’s ZoC\nand must be in BtB with a Scenario\nObjective . Turn the Activating model\nto face the objective . See the specific\nScenario to resolve any other effects\nof the Action .\nActions\nIf a model’s action becomes invalid\nor illegal after the model’s action has\nbeen declared, that model’s activation\nends immediately and it loses one\nActivation Counter, regardless of the\naction declared .\nIf an effect or Ki Feat causes a model’s\nactivation to end directly (Mirage,\nSnare, etc) follow that effect’s rules\ninstead .\n32 Tests\nTo see whether a model’s action is\nsuccessful, and how successful, often\nrequires a test .\nThere are two types of tests in Bushido,\nOpposed and Challenge . Both tests\ninvolve rolling D6’s . Opposed tests pit\nboth players against each other, while\nChallenge Tests require one player to\nroll dice against a Challenge Number .\nIf the result on a dice is a natural 1\n(After rerolls) then it is ignored when\ncalculating the result of the dice roll, it\nis removed from the pool entirely and\ndoes not count for tiebreakers when\ncounting the number of dice rolled . If\nall dice rolled result in 1’s, then the final\nresult is considered 0 .\nIf, naturally or because of negative\nmodifiers, a model’s Statistic value\nused for an Opposed or Challenge test\nis 0 or less the player still rolls a single\ndice . In Opposed tests, both players\ngain a dice in their pool until both\nplayers have at least one dice .\nRemember that two numbers represent\na model’s Ki, the Ki Statistic and the\nMaximum Ki Limit . When conducting\ntests relying on the Ki Statistic, the\nMaximum Ki Limit is not relevant .\nWhen declaring the use of Ki Feats\n(Including Ki Boosts) during any test,\nthe Opponent declares first and the\nActivating model or the Model with\nthe Initiative if in a Melee Exchange,\ndeclares second .\nCONDUCTING RE-ROLLS\nIf dice must be re-rolled, then re-rolls\nshould be conducted in the following\norder with Model A being the model with\nthe initiative or the Activating model,\nand Model B being the Opponent:\n1 . Model B picks any of Model A’s dice;\nthese dice are then re-rolled . Model\nB then picks any of their own dice;\nthese dice are then re-rolled .\n2. Model A picks any of Model B’s dice;\nthese dice are then re-rolled . Model\nA then picks any of their own dice;\nthese dice are then re-rolled .\nTESTS\nExample: Wu-Zang has a base melee pool of\n1. In a melee exchange, Wu-Zang is Exhausted\nand has a Stunned Marker. His current Melee\nPool is -1. His opponent, Jin has 3 Melee Pool.\nBoth players gain two dice to bring Wu-Zang\nup to one dice and his opponent to 5 dice.\nExample: Hanzo has a Ki Statistic\nof 2 and a Maximum Ki Limit of 6,\nrepresented as 2/6 on his profile card.\nWhen Hanzo takes a test relying on the\nKi Statistic, his dice pool is two before\nany modifiers.\n33\nOPPOSED TESTS\nThese type of tests require two\nmodels to roll a number of dice equal\nto the Statistic value for the test . For\nan Opposed Melee Test, for example,\nyou would roll a number of dice equal\nto the models’ Melee Pool Statistics .\nOpposed Tests are resolved in the\nfollowing order:\n1 . The models calculate their dice\npools, deciding if they will use any\nabilities, Ki Feats or increase the\nStatistic being used through a\nKi Boost . The Active player\ndeclares second .\n2 .Both players then roll\ntheir dice and conduct\nany re-rolls .\n3 .Both players remove\nany dice with a value\nof 1 .\n4 .The models apply any\nmodifiers necessary to their\nhighest dice result rolled .Next, up\nto two additional dice that were\nnot removed contribute +1 per dice\nto the final result of the roll . These\nadditional dice are called Supporting\nDice .\n5 . The final results are then compared,\nthe successful model being the\none with the highest final result . If\none model is successful, the other\nis not .The difference between the\nfinal results is the Success Level of\nthe test .\nIn the case of final results being equal,\ntiebreakers are used in the following\norder:\n1 . The player who rolled the highest\nnumber of dice (subtracting rolls of\n1 from the total) wins .\n2 . Otherwise, the Active Player wins .\nTests\n34\nCHALLENGE TESTS\nThese type of tests require one model\nto roll a number of dice equal to the\nStatistic value for the test . These\nwill be called out with a Challenge\nNumber in brackets, for example, Ki\nChallenge Test (5) or Move Challenge\nTest (6) . The Challenge Number is\nthe number that must be equalled\nor exceeded by the final result of the\ndice rolled . If no Statistic is specified,\nthen the Challenge test is made using\na single D6 . The Challenge Number\ncan also be modified; it is possible for\nthe Challenge number to be zero or\nnegative .\nROLLING A CHALLENGE TEST\n1 . Calculate the model’s dice pool,\ndeciding if they will use any abilities,\nKi Feats or increase the Statistic\nbeing used through a Ki Boost .\n2 . Roll the dice and conduct any re-\nrolls .\n3 . Remove any dice with a value of 1 .\n4 .Apply any modifiers necessary to\nthe highest dice result rolled . Next,\nup to two additional dice that were\nnot removed contribute +1 per dice\nto the final result of the roll . These\nadditional dice are called Supporting\nDice .\n5 . The final result is then compared to\nthe Challenge Number; if the Result\nequals or exceeds the Challenge\nNumber, the Challenge Test is\nSuccessful . For tests requiring\na Success Level, the difference\nbetween the final result and the\nChallenge Number is the Success\nLevel for the test .\nTests\n35\nSIZE CHALLENGE TESTS\nA Size Challenge Test is a Challenge\nTest using a model’s Size in place\nof a Statistic . A model taking a Size\nChallenge Test rolls a number of dice\nbased on its size as shown in the table\nbelow . Modifiers are then applied to\nthe result of the roll if applicable .\nSize Number of Dice\nTiny 1\nSmall 2\nMedium 3\nLarge 4\nHuge 5\nTrait Modifier\nStrong +1\nWeak -1\nSwarm -1\nTACTICAL TESTS\nTactical tests occur at deployment\n(p23) and at the beginning of every\nturn (p24) . Both players nominate\na model to perform an Opposed\ntest using a single D6 (applying any\nmodifiers from traits) .\nIn the case of a tie after checking the\nnumber of Dice, there is no Active\nPlayer during this roll, so the test must\nbe taken again .\nFEAR CHALLENGE TESTS\nFear tests are Challenge tests using\nthe model’s Ki Statistic . Any effects\nthat affect Ki Challenge Tests also\naffect Fear Tests .\nModels with the Fear (X) trait,\nautomatically pass Fear tests with a\nChallenge Number equal to or lower\nthan their Fear (X) trait . They still take\na Fear test if the Challenge Number is\nhigher than their Fear (X) trait .\nResolve a Fear Test when:\n1 . An Activating model declares an\naction or effect that would bring\nit into BtB with an Enemy model\nwith the Fear trait . If the Activating\nmodel fails the Fear test, regardless\nof the action declared, remove one\nactivation counter, (see actions,\np .28), and its activation ends . It\ndoes not enter the Frightened\nState .\n2 . An Activating model with the Fear\ntrait declares an action that would\nbring it into BtB with an Enemy\nmodel . If the Enemy model fails\nits Fear test then it enters the\nFrightened State (See Model States,\np .52) .\nTests\n36\n1 . a) If the model is in BtB with an enemy\nmodel, the ranged attack fails,\nmove to step 7 . If the Model has\nmultiple ranged Weapons, choose\nwhich one it will make the Ranged\nAttack with .\nb) Target a model .\nc) Measure the distance to the Enemy\nmodel and check this distance\nagainst the weapon’s Range Bands\nto see which Range the Ranged\nAttack is at (see Profile Cards,\np .12) I.f the distance is further\nthan the Long Range of the weapon\nthe action fails, move to step 7 .\nd) The player Controlling the Targeted\nmodel may at this point nominate a\ndifferent Friendly model as the new\nTarget if:\ni . Any line from the Attacker\ncrosses through the nominated\nmodel’s ZoC before contacting\nthe original Target’s Base .\nii . The nominated model is able\nto draw LoS to the Activating\nmodel and is a valid target for\nthe Ranged Attack .\niii .The nominated model is not\nExhausted or Insignificant .\niv . If a model was nominated and the\nsteps I, ii and iii were met, then the\nnominated model becomes the\nTargeted model . The new target\ncannot gain cover unless both the\noriginal target and the nominated\nmodel had cover from the attacker.\ne) Players declare the use of any Ki Feats,\ntraits or Unique Effects by any model .\nThe active player declares second .\nResolve any Ki Feats, traits or\nUnique Effects at the correct time,\nin case of conflict, resolve the\nactive player’s effects first .\nf) Challenge Number of the Ranged\nAttack test is calculated based on the\nRange Band as well as any applicable\nmodifiers .\ng) At this point, if the chosen Weapon\nhas the Ammo trait, check if it has\nAmmo tokens; if not, this ranged\nattack ends - skip to step 7 .\nIf the Weapon has the Reload trait,\ncheck if it has any Reload markers .\nIf it does, this ranged attack ends -\nskip to step 7 .\nRANGED ATTACKS\nRanged Attacks\nA model must have a ranged weapon to make a Ranged Attack . A Ranged Attack is a\ntype of Challenge Test, and the usual rules apply . During a Ranged Attack the use of\nInstant and Active Ki Feats, as well as Effects that can be used as Instants, is restricted .\nA model making a Ranged Attack may be referred to as “The Attacker”.\nTo make a Ranged Attack take a number of dice equal to the Attacker’s Ranged Pool\nStatistic, modified by any Instant Ki Feats, Ki Boosts, and Special Attacks . Determine the\nChallenge number based on Range and other relevant modifiers . Make a Challenge test\nas normal, followed by a Damage Roll based on the Success Level of the test .\nIf a Ranged Attack Targets a model in BtB with a Friendly model you will need to determine\nif you hit your Target or the Friendly model (See Targeting a Model in BtB, p .38) .\n37\n2 . The Active Player then calculates\nthe dice pool using the model’s\nRanged pool Statistic as the base\nnumber of dice used, then decides\nif they will use any of its abilities,\nuse a Ki feat or increase its Ranged\npool Statistic through a Ki Boost .\na) The Active Player then rolls their\ndice .\nb) The Active Player conducts any\nre-rolls of dice .\nc) The Active Player then selects\nthe highest dice and up to two\nsupporting dice, that did not roll\na 1, will add +1 to the highest dice\nrolled .This gives the final result\nof the Ranged Attack test .\n3 . The player compares the final result\nagainst the Challenge Number . If the\nAttack is a success continue to Step\n4 a) and 4 b) . If the Attack has failed\nskip to Step 6 .\n4 . a) The players declare the use of\nany Instant or Active Ki Feats\n(Active player declares last) .\nb) If the target was in BtB with an\nenemy model, you must now\ncheck to see if you hit the correct\ntarget .\n5 . The Active Player then makes a\nDamage Roll against the Target\nmodel .\na) Any model may use instant Ki\nfeats at this step .\n6 . The model gains any Reload markers\nand removes Ammo Tokens (if\napplicable) from the weapon on the\nmodel’s profile card .\n7 . The Ranged Attack is now resolved .\na . Any Boosts used for this attack\nexpire .\nRanged Attacks\nDETERMINING THE RANGED\nATTACK CHALLENGE NUMBER\nRange Band Challenge Number\nShort 4\nMedium 5\nLong 6\nEffect Modifier\nTarget is Tiny + 1\nTarget is Small + 0\nTarget is Medium - 1\nTarget is Large - 2\nTarget is Huge - 3\nTarget is Prone - 1\nTarget is Surprised - 1\nTarget is in Cover + 2\nTarget Ran (this turn) + 1\nAttacking Model Ran\n(this turn)\n+ 1\nAttacking Model Moved,\nor will Move, as part of\nthis action\n+ 1\nAttacking Model already\nmade a Ranged Attack\nthis turn .\n+ 1\nTraits and Effects may also modify the roll.\n38\nTARGETING A MODEL IN BTB\nIf a model Targets an Enemy model in\nBtB with a Friendly model then at step\n4b, make a Ranged Challenge test (6),\nwith the following modifiers .\nTarget is Tiny +1\nTarget is Medium -1\nTarget is Large -2\nTarget is Huge Automatic Success\nIf the test is successful proceed as\nnormal . If the test is a failure the\nTarget of the Attack is changed to the\nnearest Friendly model in BtB with the\noriginal Target . The Ranged Attack\ncontinues with the new Target .\nExample: Model A has clear LoS to model B.\nModel A has no LoS to model C because model\nG has a larger base size and blocks LoS.\nModel A has LoS to model D, but since LoS passes\nthrough Obscuring terrain, model D has cover.\nModel A’s LoS to model E would be completely\nblocked by the wall, but the wall is Tiny, so\ndoes not block LoS to the small based model\nE. Model E therefore has Cover.\nThe rock is Large, so completely blocks LoS\nfrom model A to model F.\nRanged Attack Example: The Active Player\nactivates Tamotsu and declares a Ranged\nAttack Action. The range is 9”, this is Medium\nRange for Tamotsu’s Bow and has base\nChallenge number of 5.\nChecking modifiers, we add +1 to the Challenge\nnumber for moving and +1 because the Target\nis Tiny for a final Challenge number of 7.\nTamotsu has Ranged Pool 3.\nRolling a total of 8 (6+1+1=8) Tamotsu has a\nSuccess Level of 1. Now make a Damage Roll on\nthe Success Level 1 column.\nWall\nForest\nRockA\nb\nc d e\nf\ng\nRanged Attacks\n\n40\nA Melee Attack is a type of Opposed\ntest, and all the usual rules apply, during\na Melee Attack the use of Instant and\nActive Ki Feats (And effects that can\nbe used as Instants) is restricted . For\na Melee Exchange, however, two tests\nare rolled simultaneously, with each\nmodel rolling Attack and Defence dice\nat the same time and applying traits\nto see which model comes out of the\nexchange victorious .\nMELEE EXCHANGES\nA Melee Exchange represents the\nawesome conflicts between the\ncharacters of Bushido using Katanas,\nMartial Arts, claws and teeth, Magical\nabilities and other stranger fighting\ntechniques .\nMelee exchanges usually occur as part\nof a Melee Action which allows you to\nmove into BtB contact; often a melee\naction will be declared when already\nin BtB contact .\nOnce in BtB turn both models to\nface directly toward each other . Next\nplayers may declare any Instant\nKi feats that will affect the melee,\nincluding Ki boosting the melee pool .\nThe defender declares first .\nNext players allocate dice pools .\nSecretly take your dice (You should\nhave two colours of Dice, one for\nattack and one for Defence) and\nassign them, so you have a total equal\nto your melee pool .\nYou also need to remove dice from\nthe Melee Pool to pay for any Special\nAttack or Defence .\nOnce both players have secretly\nallocated dice, reveal any special\nAttack or Defence and roll all the dice\ntogether .\nIn Bushido, dice with a value of 1 are\nremoved from tests . Put them to one\nside they are not counted for the rest\nof the melee exchange .\nThe Active player’s model attacks first .\nTake the value of the highest attack\ndice rolled, and also up to two other\nattack dice to become a supporting\ndice which each add +1 to the highest\nvalue, to find the result of the attack .\nExample: Hiro is involved in a Melee Exchange,\nhe has Melee Pool of 4 and spends 3 Ki to add\nanother dice.\nHe now has 5 Dice in his Melee Pool and must\nsplit them into Attack and Defence. He can\nchoose to put all 5 in Attack, 4 in Attack and 1\nin Defence, 3 in Attack and 2 in Defence or any\ncombination totalling 5 dice.\nMELEE EXCHANGES\nMelee Exchanges\n41\nThe defender does the same with their\ndefence dice, taking the highest and\nadding +1 for each supporting dice .\nIf the Attacker succeeds, the difference\nbetween the final results is the Success\nLevel of the attack .\nAny Special Attack or Defence is\napplied depending on the outcome .\nThis is used, along with a 2D6 Damage\nRoll on the damage table to find the\ntotal damage of the attack . (See\nDamage Roll p .45)\nAssuming the defender is still around\nto make an attack, the defending\nplayer can now total his Attack Dice\nin the same way and check against\nthe Attackers Defence to see if he\nalso caused damage or uses a Special\nAttack or Defence .\nOnce the Melee Exchange is over,\nremove an Activation Counter from\nboth models .\nMasaema Aya is in BtB with Chiyo .\nShe activates and declares a Melee\naction .\nAya has Melee Pool 3 and wants to\ntry to damage her opponent, she\nsecretly allocates 2 dice to attack\nand only 1 to defence relying on her\narmour to protect her .\nNeither player declares any Ki Feats .\nChiyo declares Sidestep Defence, Aya\ndoes not use a Special .\nMasaema Aya rolls red dice for attack\nand a black dice with red pips for\ndefence, while Chiyo rolls green dice\nfor attack and a black dice with green\npips for defence .\nBoth players then roll at the same time.\nAya has a total of 5 for her attack and\nChiyo has 4 in defence . Aya gets a\nSuccess Level 1 damage roll .\nChiyo has a total of 6 in attack and\nAya has 5 in defence, she also gets a\nSuccess Level 1 damage roll .\nEXAMPLE MELEE EXCHANGE\nMelee Exchanges\n42\nNote, this timing chart covers every eventuality of combinations of Abilities, Ki Feats, Special\nAttacks and Defences and all manner of other ‘in game’ occurrences.\nUse the following steps to resolve a Melee Exchange:\nMelee Exchanges\n1 . If the two models are in BtB, rotate both\nmodels so that their Facings are aligned\nwith each other . Otherwise Skip to Step 7a .\n2 . Choose which weapon will be used for\nthe exchange, non-Activating model\nfirst . This will determine which Traits\nand Special attacks and defences are\navailable .\n3 . a) Determine which model has the\nInitiative . The model with the Initiative\nis the Attacker the other model the\nDefender . By default, Activating\nmodels have the Initiative, but some\ntraits and States may change this .\nIn all the following steps, the player\nwithout the initiative declares any non-\nsimultaneous effects first .Regardless\nof Initiative the Active Player and\nActivating Model do not change .\nb) Both players may now use Instant Ki\nFeats to change the initiative. The non-\nActivating player declares first . If the\ninitiative was changed, the Activating\nplayer may then also declare Instant Ki\nFeats to change the initiative .\nc) The initiative is now set and cannot be\nchanged .\n4 . Both players then calculate their model’s\ndice pool using its Melee Pool Statistic\nvalue as the base number of dice used\nand apply any modifiers . They then decide\nif they will use any abilities, Ki Feats or\nincrease the Melee pool Statistic through\na Ki Boost. The Player without the Initiative\nmust declare everything before the Player\nwith the Initiative .\n5 . Once the players have calculated\ntheir dice pools, they must both\nsecretly decide how to allocate the\ndice between Attack and Defence .\nIf players are using a Special Attack\nor Special Defence, then they must\nsecretly remove a number of dice\nfrom their pool equal to the cost of\nthe Special Attack or Defence (p.47).\nAlso include the use of any effects,\nincluding Instant (or Active for the\nactive player) Ki Feats, which alter\nthe cost of Attacks or Defences, or\nadd additional Attacks or Defences .\nThe Dice allocation, choice of Special\nAbility, and any additional choices\ngained are Hidden Information until\nsimultaneously revealed .\n6 . Once both players have allocated\ntheir dice:\na) Declare the use of any effects used\nwhich alter the cost of Attacks\nor Defences or add additional\nAttacks or Defences (You will\nhave secretly decided the use of\nthese abilities in Step 5) .\nb) Announce simultaneously if they\nare using a Special Attack or Defence.\nc) Remember a model can only\nuse one Special Attack or\nDefence, not both types .\n7 . a) If the models are still in BtB both\nplayers roll all their dice\nsimultaneously; otherwise, the\nmelee action ends now, the\nActivating model removes an\nactivation counter .\n43\nb) Perform any re-rolls in the order\ngiven in Conducting Re-rolls\n(p .32), then remove or add dice\nlast . See for example Unblockable,\nImpenetrable Defence traits\n(p.73 - p.66).\n8 . Both players then calculate their\nfinal Attack and Defence results\nby selecting the highest dice of\neach type (Defence and Attack),\neach player then collects up to two\ndice rolled of each type (Attack &\nDefence) which were not 1’s . Each\nof these supporting dice will add\n+1 to the highest dice rolled . The\nplayers apply any modifiers from\ntraits and effects to their highest\ndice rolled to get their model’s final\nAttack and Defence results .\na) Remember, if a player rolls no\ndice of one type then their final\nresult of that type is 0 . If a player\nrolls no Attack dice, then no\nDamage Roll is made in Step 9 .\n9 . If no dice are allocated to Attack,\nany Special Attacks do not trigger .\nIf no dice are allocated to Defence,\nany Special Defences do not trigger.\nAny dice that are 1’s are not counted\ntowards resolving the test but still\ncount towards the player having\nallocated dice in the appropriate\ndice pool .\nMelee Exchanges\n10 .The Attacker compares its final Attack\nresult against the Defender’s final\nDefence result, using Tiebreakers if\nnecessary Note: when checking which\nplayer has the most dice for tiebreakers,\ncount all attack and defence dice (That\ndid not roll 1s) for both players towards\ntiebreakers for both attack and defence .\na) If the Attacker was successful apply\nthe effects of any Special Attacks used\nby the Attacker and move to Step 11 .\nb) If the Defender was successful apply\nany Special Defences used by the\nDefender . If this results in either model\nbeing removed from the table, the\ndefender no longer being in BtB with\nthe Attacker, or the defender becoming\nProne, skip to Step 14 otherwise move\nto Step 13 .\n11 . The players declare the use of any\nInstant (or Active for the active player)\nKi Feats for models involved in the Melee\nExchange .\n12 .The Attacker makes a Damage Roll\nagainst the Defender and resolves any\neffects triggered by damage in melee . If\nat the end of this step either the Defender\nmodel is removed from the table, is no\nlonger in BtB with the Attacker, or is\nProne skip to Step 14 .\n13 .Run through from Step 10 with the\nDefender becoming the Attacker unless it\nhas already been the Attacker this Melee\nExchange .\n14 .The Melee Exchange is now resolved,\nand both models remove one activation\ncounter .\n15 .Any Boosts used for this Melee Exchange\nexpire .\n44 Melee Exchanges\nMELEE POOL MODIFIERS\nEffect Dice Pool Modifier\nModel is\nExhausted\n-1\nMelee Assist\n-1 per model\nAssisting\nModel is Prone,\nBlind, Stunned,\nFrightened, Held .\n-1 per State\nModel Ran this\nturn\n-1\nModel is Surprised -1\nModel declared a\nStand Up action\n-1\nMELEE ASSIST\nModels in Melee Exchanges suffer a\n-1 modifier for each Enemy model in\nBtB with which they are not currently\nresolving a Melee Exchange, and\nwhich is not also in BtB with a Friendly\nmodel . The enemy model is said to be\nAssisting the Melee .\n45\nThe Success Level indicates which column of the Wound Table the player should\nconsult . The player then makes a Damage Roll using 2D6, adding together results\nalong with any positive or negative modifiers, the result of which determines which\nrow to use to find the number of wounds inflicted by the attack . 1’s are not failures\nwhen making a Damage Roll .

A\nwide variety of different abilities can\nbe used in a melee exchange .\nIf a model is able to attempt one of\nthese Special Attacks or Defences, it\nwill appear on the model’s profile card\nin the weapon grid (see Profile Cards,\np .12) .A model can only use a special\nattack or defence if it is using the\nweapon that has it on its grid .These\nspecial abilities allow a model to trigger\na special effect if it uses the ability and\nsuccessfully Attacks or Defends .\nAll Special Attacks and Defences have\na bracketed cost after the name text .\nE.g. Sidestep Defence (1)\nThis is the number of dice to remove\nfrom the model’s Melee or Ranged\nPool (as appropriate) if it chooses\nto use a Special Attack or Defence . A\nmodel’s dice pool cannot be reduced\nto 0 through the use of a Special\nAttack or Defence, and if this would\nhappen the player cannot declare that\nSpecial Attack or Defence .\nA model may only perform one Special\nAttack or Defence per Melee Exchange\nor Ranged Attack .\nSPECIAL ABILITIES\nSpecial Abilities\n48\nSome special Abilities can cause models to move when successful . All movement\nfrom Special Abilities ignore enemy model’s ZoC and being in BtB .\n• If through a Special Attack or\nDefence a model would be moved\npast the edge of the game area\nthen it stops when its base touches\nthe edge of the board .\n• If through a movement from a\nSlam Attack, Throw Attack or\nThrow Defence a model is moved\ninto BtB with another model then,\ndependant on the two models’\nSizes, one of the following occurs:\n• If the model contacted is of equal\nsize, the moving model stops at\nthe point at which it entered BtB,\nand both models become Prone .\n• If the model contacted is of a\nlarger Size, the moving model\nstops at the point at which it\nentered BtB and becomes Prone .\n• If the model contacted is of a smaller\nSize, the moving model continues\nits movement and pushes the\nmodel it contacted directly away\nfrom the point of contact a\ndistance that would enable the\nmoving model to continue its\nmovement without contacting\nthe model . Both models become\nProne at the end of the movement.\n• If through a movement from a\nPush Attack, Forceback Attack,\nDrag Defence or Push Defence\na model is moved into BtB with\nanother model then the moving\nmodel stops at the point at\nwhich it entered BtB .\n• If an Impassable Terrain element\nwould prevent this movement, then\nthe model must stop at the point of\ncontact with the Terrain element .\nIf this was due to a Slam Attack,\nThrow Attack or Throw Defence, the\nmodel also becomes prone .\nRanged attacks will never have\nSpecial Defences because there are\nno defence dice for a ranged attack .\nHowever, ranged weapons may have\nSpecial Attacks on their weapon grid .\nA model that gains a special ability by\nany means can only use that ability\nfor melee weapons unless otherwise\nstated .\nSpecial Abilities\n49Special Abilities\nSPECIAL ATTACKS\nCombo Attack: If the Attack is\nsuccessful then after resolving a\nDamage Roll, deduct 2 from the Success\nLevel of the Attack . If the new Success\nLevel is 0 or greater make another\nDamage Roll against the Defender .\nRepeat this process until the Success\nLevel is less than 0. If the Success Level\nof the original attack was 0 or 1, after\nresolving a Damage Roll, make one\nadditional Damage Roll against the\nDefender at Success Level 0 .\nNote: If a model has abilities that trigger\nwhen damage is caused each damage roll\nwill trigger those abilities separately.\nCritical Attack: If this model’s Attack\nis successful, and the individual dice\nresults of the Damage Roll are the\nsame number, remove the Defender\nfrom play .\nDrag Attack: If the Attack is successful,\nmove the Attacker 1” away from the\nDefender, then move the Defender\n1” directly towards the Attacker . The\nDefender does not suffer a Damage\nRoll from this Attack .\nDual Attack: If the Attack is Successful,\nafter rolling Damage, make one more\nDamage roll at the same success level .\nForceback Attack: If the Attack is\nsuccessful, move the Defender 1”\ndirectly away from the Attacker, then\nmove the Attacker 1” directly towards\nthe Attacker . The Defender suffers half\nthe Wounds from the Damage Roll\ncaused by this Attack .\nGrapple Attack: If the attack is\nsuccessful, the Defender becomes\nHeld . Place a Held marker on the\nDefender . The Defender does not suffer\na Damage roll from this Attack but may\nnot attack during this Melee Exchange .\nPowerful Attack: If the Attack is\nsuccessful, then the Attacker gains +3 to\nthe Damage Roll caused by this Attack .\nPush Attack: If the Attack is successful,\nmove the Defender directly away from\nthis model until it leaves this model’s\nZoC . The Defender does not suffer a\nDamage Roll from this Attack .\nSidestep Attack: If the Attack is\nsuccessful, the Attacker leaves BtB and\nthen moves away from the Defender\nuntil The Attacker leaves the Defender’s\nZoC, at which point its movement ends.\nThe Defender does not suffer a Damage\nRoll from this Attack .\nSlam Attack: If the Attack is successful,\nthe Defender is moved 3” directly away\nfrom the Attacker and becomes Prone .\nThe Defender suffers half the Wounds\nfrom the Damage Roll caused by this\nAttack .\nStun Attack: If the attack is Successful,\nthe Defender gains a Stunned Marker\nafter the Damage Roll .\nSweep Attack: If the Attack is\nsuccessful, then the Defender\nbecomes Prone .The Defender suffers\nhalf the wounds from the Damage Roll\ncaused by this Attack .\nThrow Attack: If the Attack is\nsuccessful, the Defender is moved 2” in\na straight line and becomes Prone . The\nDefender suffers half the Wounds from\nthe Damage Roll caused by this Attack .\n50\nSPECIAL DEFENCES\nCounterstrike Defence: If this\nDefence is successful, and the\nAttacker allocated any dice to Attack,\nthen deduct 2 from the Success Level\nof the Defence . If the Success Level\nis 0 or greater, then make a Damage\nRoll against the Attacker using the\nmodified Success Level of the Defence.\nDrag Defence: If the Defence is\nsuccessful, move the Defender 1”\naway from the Attacker, then move\nthe Attacker directly into BtB with the\nDefender .\nForceback Defence: If the Defence\nis successful, move the Attacker 1”\ndirectly away from the Defender, then\nmove the Defender directly into BtB\nwith the Attacker .\nGrapple Defence: If the Defence is\nsuccessful, the Attacker becomes Held .\nPlace a Held marker on the Attacker\nPush Defence: If the Defence is\nsuccessful, move the Attacker directly\naway from the Defender until it leaves\nthe defender’s ZoC .\nSidestep Defence: If the Defence\nis successful, the Defender leaves\nBtB and then moves away from the\nAttacker until the Defender leaves\nthe Attacker’s ZoC, at which point its\nmovement ends .\nSweep Defence: If the Defence is\nsuccessful, then the Attacker becomes\nProne .\nThrow Defence: If the Defence is\nsuccessful, the Attacker is moved 2” in\na straight line and becomes Prone .\nE XCEPTIONAL ATTACKS\nAND DEFENCES\nSome techniques are only known to\na few Masters of the sword or fist .\nExceptional attacks and defences are\ndetailed on individual profile cards; a\nfew examples are detailed below .\nEagle’s Flight Defence: If the Defence\nis successful this model may Move\n3” after the Melee Exchange is\nresolvedIvory .\nIvory Prison Attack: If this Attack\nis successful then remove the non-\nInsignificant, non-Soulless Target from\nplay and deploy a Prone, non-unique\nKairai under your control by replacing\nthe target\nGokusatsu Attack: If this attack is\nSuccessful, remove the defender and\nattacker from play . If the enemy model\nhas this Exceptional Attack, then\nthis attack has no effect on either\ncombatant .\nWeb Defence: If this model successfully\nDefends, the Enemy model may not move\nuntil the current activation has ended .\nSpecial Abilities\nAkio (blue) is the attacking model .\nThe defender is moved 1” directly\naway from the attacker .\nThe attacker is then moved directly\nforward into BtB with the defender .\nAfter the Damage roll, the Damage is\nhalved (rounding down) .\nAkio (blue) is the attacking model .\nThe defender is moved directly away\nfrom the attacker until they leave the\nattacker’s Zone of Control .\nNo damage roll is made .\nAkio (blue) is the attacking model .\nThe attacker may move away from the\ndefender any distance until it leaves\nthe defender’s Zone of Control .\nNo damage roll is made .\nAkio (blue) is the attacking model .\nThe Defender is moved 3” directly\naway from the Attacker and gains a\nProne marker .\nAfter the damage roll, the damage is\nhalved (rounding down) .\nAkio (blue) is the Attacking model .\nThe Defender is moved 2” away from\nthe Attacker to a point in LoS of the\nAttacker .\nThe Attacker may choose the\nmovement path .\nAfter the Damage Roll, the damage is\nhalved (rounding down) .\nFORCEBACK ATTACK\nPUSH ATTACK\nSIDESTEP ATTACK\nSLAM ATTACK\nTHROW ATTACK\n1”\n3”\n2”\n1”\n52\nA model may enter into a number of different States during a game . A model may\nbe in more than one State at a time . Markers should be placed on a model, or its\nprofile card to indicate a model’s State to the Opponent .\nBerserk: While a model has\na Berserk marker, it gains the\nAggressive trait . When a model\ngains a Berserk marker, it gains an\nImpetuous marker .\nWhen a Berserk model activates check\nthe following steps in order until one\napplies:\n• If in range, this model must select\nthe nearest valid Enemy model and\ndeclare a Melee Action .\n• If in range and this model has two\nActivation counters, this model must\ndeclare a Charge Action and Target\nthe nearest valid Enemy model .\n• This model turns to directly face\nthe nearest Enemy model and\nmust declare a Run action directly\ntowards that model, running the\nmaximum distance possible .\n• If the model is unable to Target or\nSelect an Enemy and unable to\ndeclare a Run Action, it may instead\nperform any action .\nDuring the End Phase remove all Berserk\nmarkers in play .\nBleed: If a model has Bleed\nmarkers it is considered to\nbe Bleeding . During the End\nPhase remove the highest\nvalue Bleed marker; the model suffers\na number of wounds equal to the\nremoved Bleed marker’s value . After\nthis, if the model still has three or more\nBleed markers, repeat the process,\ncontinuing to do so until the model\nhas only 2 markers .\nIf a Bleeding model Heals any of\nits marked wounds from its wound\ntrack by any means, remove all Bleed\nmarkers from it .\nBlind: If a model has a Blind\nmarker it cannot draw LoS\noutside of BtB and suffers a\n-1 Melee Pool modifier during Melee\nexchanges . Blind models may not\ndeclare Run or Charge Actions . During\nthe End, Phase remove all Blind\nmarkers from each model with any\nBlind markers. Models with Sixth Sense\nautomatically have Immune [Blind] .\nMODEL STATES\nModel States\n53\nControlled: A Controlled\nmodel switches Warbands for\na number of actions dependant\non the number of Control markers it has.\nWhilst Controlled the model generates\nKi Tokens normally, but cannot spend\nor remove any Tokens it possesses, Ki\nor otherwise . The controlling player\nmay declare any action the model\nwould normally be able to perform\nwithout spending Tokens .\nFor each Activation Counter removed\nfromthemodel(orifamodelparticipates\nin a Melee Exchange without removing\nan Activation Counter); also remove\na Control marker . If a model has only\none Control Marker, it cannot declare\nComplex Actions . As soon as all the\nControl Markers are removed, the\nmodel returns to the original player’s\nWarband . While Controlled, if an\neffect applies further Control Markers,\ninstead remove one marker for each\nControl marker the effect would add .\nDeath Sentence: While\na model with any Death\nSentence markers is the target\nof a Ranged Attack or is involved in a\nMelee Exchange, the Enemy model\ngains +1 Melee Pool or +1 Ranged Pool\nas well as +1 to any Damage Rolls . The\nbenefit for the Attacker is the same\nwhether the target has one or multiple\nDeath Sentence markers . During the\nStarting Phase, a model with a Death\nSentence marker may spend 3 Ki to\nremove one Death Sentence marker\nfrom itself .\nDiseased: If a model has Disease\nmarkers then during the Starting\nPhase remove a Disease marker\nand an Activation counter .\nDisguised: While a model has\na Disguised (X) marker, Enemy\nmodels with a Ki Statistic of 1 or\nless cannot Target or voluntarily move\ninto BtB with the Disguised model .\nIf the enemy model has a Ki Statistic\nof 2 or greater, when making a Ranged\nAttack or Ki Feat against a Disguised\nmodel, once the attack or Feat has\nbeen determined to be in range, the\nEnemy model must make a Challenge\n(X) Ki test where X is the highest value\nof Disguise Marker on the Target model.\nWhen attempting to move into BtB,\ndetermine if the model has enough\nmovement to reach BtB and if so,\nmake a Challenge (X) Ki test .\nIf the Enemy model is successful remove\nthe Disguise marker and resolve the\naction as normal . If unsuccessful its\nactivation ends before any movement,\nand it removes an activation counter as\nif it had completed the attempted action.\nIf a Disguised model declares a\nMelee, Ranged, Charge or Scenario\naction; uses the Bodyguard trait; or\nparticipates in a Melee Exchange;\nremove its Disguise marker . While a\nmodel is Disguised enemy models may\nignore its ZoC .\nModel States\n54\nFrightened: This model gains\nthe Defensive trait and suffers\na -1 Melee Pool and Ranged\nPool modifier . It may not declare\nactions that would move it into BtB\nwith Enemy models with the Fear trait .\nDuring the Main Phase, Frightened\nmodels automatically fail Fear tests .\nDuring the End Phase, the model\nmust take another Fear test with the\nsame Challenge Number as it failed\nwhen entering the Frightened State .\nIf successful or if no Fear Test was\nfailed, remove all Frightened markers .\nHeld: As long as a model is\nHeld it gains the Defensive trait\nand cannot declare any actions\nexcept Disengage, Ki Feats usable in\nMelee or Stand Up. A Held model cannot\nmove or be moved, except to change\nfacing, and suffers a -1 Melee Pool .\nRemove the model’s Held marker when:\n· The Holding model is no longer in BtB\nwith the Held model .\n· The Holding model participates in a\nMelee exchange with another model.\n· Or the Held model has successfully\nDisengaged from the Holding model .\nA Model with the Intangible or Agile trait\nhas Immune [Held] .\nImmobilised: When an\nImmobilised model declares a\nMelee, Run, Charge, Scenario,\nStand Up, Heal, or any action including\nmovement (Including changing facing;\nbefore the action, the model must\nmake a Size (6) Challenge test .\nIf unsuccessful the model’s action is\nconsidered resolved . If successful the\nmodel removes all Immobilised markers\nand resolves its action as normal .\nAn Immobilised model cannot declare\nthe use of Special attacks or Defences.\nA model can declare a Wait action to\nremove all Immobilised markers. Enemy\nmodels in BtB with an Immobilised\nmodel can declare actions as if they\nwere not in BtB .\nIf any other effect moves an\nImmobilised model, then remove all\nImmobilised markers from it .\nIntangible models have Immune\n[Immobilised] .\nModel States\n55\nImpetuous: As long as any\nmodel in a Warband has\nan impetuous marker and\nany Activation Counters no models\nwithout an impetuous marker may\nactivate . Remove one impetuous\nmarker when the model performs\nan action consuming any number of\nactivation counters .\nOn Fire: If a model has Fire\nmarkers it is considered to be\nOn Fire . During the End Phase\nremove the highest value Fire marker,\nthe model suffers a number of wounds\nequal to the removed Fire marker’s\nvalue . These wounds ignore the Tough\ntrait . After this, if the model still has\nthree or more Fire markers, repeat the\nprocess, continuing to do so until the\nmodel has only 2 markers .\nA model with Fire markers on its profile\ncard, or a Friendly model in BtB, may\ntake a Wait action to remove two Fire\nmarkers from the model .\nPoisoned: If a model has\nPoison markers, it is considered\nPoisoned . During the End\nPhase remove the highest value Poison\nmarker, the model suffers a number of\nwounds equal to the removed Poison\nmarker’s value . After this, if the model\nstill has three or more Poison markers,\nrepeat the process, continuing to do\nso until the model has only 2 markers .\nProne: If a model is Prone it\nsuffers a -1 Melee Pool penalty\nand does not block LoS.\nEnemy models may ignore it’s ZoC and\nmay choose not to be considered in BtB\nwith them when declaring or performing\ntheir actions, meaning the action choice\nis not restricted by being in BtB with the\nProne model.\nProne models are always the Attacker\nsecond in Melee Exchanges and may not\nuse Special Abilities or benefit from traits\nor effects that affect Initiative .\nThe only action a Prone model may declare\nis Stand Up.\nIf a Prone model initiates a Melee Exchange\nthrough taking a Stand Up action, it suffers\n-1 Melee Pool modifier for that Melee\nExchange, but Initiative is not affected.\nA prone model cannot gain Prone Markers.\nReloading: While a model has\nReload Markers, it may not use\nany weapon with the reload\ntrait to make Ranged Attacks . A model\nmay perform a Wait Action to remove 1\nReload Marker .\nSpirit Block: If a Model has a\nSpirit Block marker it does not\ngenerate Ki Tokens during the\nKi Generation step . At the end of the\nKi Generation Step remove one Spirit\nBlock marker from each model with a\nSpirit Block marker .\nStunned: If a model has a\nStunned Marker, it suffers a -1\nMelee Pool and -1 Ranged Pool\nmodifier. During the End Phase remove\none Stunned marker from each model\nwith a Stunned marker . An affected\nmodel may take a Wait Action to\nremove all Stunned Markers .\nModel States\n56\nEach model may perform the Ki\nFeats on its profile card . Ki Feats are\ncategorised in a number of ways;\nthese explain any restrictions on a Ki\nFeat’s use, the timing of its use, its\ntype and cost in Ki Tokens to use .\nAll Feats have a cost in Ki tokens; this\ncost must be spent for the effects of the\nKi Feat to be applied. If a model does not\nhave enough Ki tokens, then it may not\ndeclare the use of the Ki Feat . The cost\nof a Ki Feat or Boost cannot be reduced\nbelow one Ki token by modifiers, but\neffects can make feats cost zero if they\nexplicitly state they do . The cost of a\nKi Feat can be expressed with either a\nfixed cost or a variable cost .\nNot in Base to Base: All Ki Feats\nmay be used while the model is in Base\nto Base contact with an enemy model\nunless it has this Icon .\nNo Movement: Models performing\nSimple and Complex Ki Feat actions\ncan Walk up to their Move stat in\ninches either before or after the Ki\nFeat is resolved unless it has this icon .\nOnce per turn:\nThis model may only use this feat once\nper turn . When the feat is used mark\nthe checkbox on the profile card. Erase\nthe checkbox in the end phase .\nOnce per game:\nThis model may only use this feat once\nper game . When the feat is used mark\nthe checkbox on the profile card .\nWhen a Ki Feat can be used depends\non its timing . Instant and Active Ki\nFeats are not considered actions .\nInstant:\n· Can be used at any time, except\nduring Melee Exchanges or Ranged\nAttacks - where the timing is\nrestricted as detailed under the\nMelee Exchanges (p .40) and\nRanged Attacks (p .36) sections .\n· Because this is not an action, it\ncan be combined with a Simple or\nComplex action if the model is the\nActivating model .\nActive:\n· Can only be used at any time when\nthis model’s Controller is the Active\nPlayer, even if it is not the Activating\nModel except during Melee\nExchanges or Ranged Attacks -\nwhere the timing is restricted as\ndetailed under the Melee Exchanges\n(p .40) and Ranged Attacks (p .36)\nsections .\n· Because this is not an action, it\ncan be combined with a Simple or\nComplex action if the model is the\nActivating model or can be used\nwhen another model is activating .\nOther than during a melee exchange\nor ranged attack, if both players wish\nto use Instant or Active Ki feats the\nactive player goes first .\nAny traits or effects that would impact\nthe result of a dice roll, test or move\nmust be declared, and any cost paid\nKI FEATS\nKi Feats\n57Ki Feats\nbefore the dice are rolled . Instant and\nActive Ki Feats as well as Ki Boosts,\ncannot be used to affect dice that\nhave already been rolled . However, Ki\nFeats that grant re-rolls may be used\nafter seeing the initial dice values .\nSimple:\n· To use a Simple Ki Feat requires the\nmodel to declare a Simple Ki Feat\naction .\n· Simple Ki Feats can only be used\nwhen the model is Activating .\nComplex:\n· To use a Complex Ki Feat requires\nthe model to declare a Complex Ki\nFeat action .\n· Complex Ki Feats can only be used\nwhen the model is Activating .\nKi Feats are further classified by whom\nthey affect:\nPersonal: The Ki Feat targets the\nuser only .\nTarget (X”): The Ki Feat affects a\nspecific Target model. The Target must be\nwithin X” otherwise the Ki Feat fails and\nthe Ki Tokens paid for the Ki Feat are lost .\nAura: The Ki Feat affects an area that\nmay be either set or variable . The area the\nAura covers is expressed as a 360-degree\nradius measured from the edge of the\nmodel’s base . It extends through Terrain\nelements and models unless stated in the\ncard text, and all models within the Aura’s\narea are affected (see Measuring Distances,\np .6) . The model from which the Aura\noriginates is always considered within the\nAura . Auras last until the End Phase or until\nthe originating model is removed from play\nif this is before the End Phase.\nPulse:The Ki Feat affects an area that\nmay be either set or variable. The area the\nPulse covers is expressed as a 360-degree\nradius measured from the edge of the\nmodel’s base . It extends through Terrain\nelements and models unless stated in the\ncard text, and all models within the Pulse’s\narea are affected . The model from which\nthe Pulse originates is always considered\nwithin the Pulse . A Pulse has no duration\nand ends as soon as the feat’s effect has\nbeen resolved .\nSpecial: The Ki Feat is unique in\nsome way and is further described on\nthe model’s profile card .\nOpposed Ki feat: Feats with this icon\nrequire an opposed Ki test with the target. If\nthe test is successful, the feat takes effect.\n58\nKI BOOSTS TO STATISTICS\nSome models can increase a Statistic\nthrough the spending of Ki Tokens\n(see Profile Cards, p .12) in the Main\nPhase . These increases are Ki Feats\nthat are Instant and Personal .\nThe cost of a Ki Feat or Ki Boost cannot\nbe reduced below one Ki Token by\nstandard modifiers, but the cost can\nbe reduced to zero if an effect states\nexplicitly it reduces the cost to zero .\nThe increase to the Statistic lasts\nuntil the current test or movement is\nresolved . Each Ki Boost is considered\na separate Ki Feat .\nExample: Sakura targets Kenko with her\nPsychic Venom Ki Feat. As she began her\nactivation in his back arc, and Kenko\nnever had LoS to her, Kenko is surprised\nand cannot use his Ki Statistic Boost to\ndefend himself.\nKi Feats\n59\nModels in Bushido commonly have\none or more traits . Some traits have\nX, Y or Descriptor values in brackets\nafter the trait’s name . This value can\nbe a positive or negative modifier, a\nrange or a Descriptor the trait affects .\nA Descriptor can be almost anything,\nfrom a profile name, Model type, a\ntrait, a kind of Test or a state .When\ntext exactly matches a Descriptor, it is\nconsidered a valid condition for game\neffects .\nIf a trait is listed on a card without an\nX or Y value, then it is assumed to be 1\nor 1”. Note that values can be negative\nnumbers. OtherTraits have restrictions,\nand those traits only apply when the\nrestrictions are met . If a trait has more\nthan one Descriptor separated by a\ncomma, it affects all models of either\nDescriptor . If a trait has more than\none Descriptor including an & symbol\nthen a model must have all listed traits\nto be affected .\nE.g. Believer [Descriptor](X/Y”):\nFriendly models within Y” of Descriptor\nreduce the cost of their Ki Feats by X. This\ntrait modifies the cost by the X value. Its\nRange is the Y” value, and it only affects\n[Descriptor] Models. Ashinaga Tenaga\nhas the Believer [Villager](1/4”) trait.\nVillagers within 4” reduce the cost of their\nKi Feats by 1.\nE.g. Strong [Melee] only applies the\nstrong trait to Melee Damage rolls. Any\nother damage rolls made are unaffected.\nE.g. Leadership [Ashigaru, Samurai]\n(1/8“) will affect all “Ashigaru” and all\n“Samurai” within 8” but Requirement [Loyal &\nSamurai] on an Enhancement card means the\ncard can only be attached to a model with both\n“Loyal” and “Samurai” keywords.”\nTRAITS\nTraits\n60\nSome traits can be listed as a trait on\nthe model or a weapon trait; these will\nbe correctly shown on the card . If a trait\nis listed with a weapon on the card, it is\ntreated as a weapon trait and only applies\nwhen choosing that weapon .\nPlayers cannot choose whether they use\ntraits but can choose in which order their\nown model’s traits trigger .Unless stated\nin their description, traits are always\nconsidered to be in effect .\nCertain game effects can give a model a\nnew trait . In some cases, where the trait\nhas no numerical values the model gains\nthe trait as stated; however, this is not\ncumulative with any existing trait . Effects\nwhich grant a Trait (X) do not stack,\ninstead choose only the highest value .\nSome effects may modify a trait’s value . If\nthe model already has the trait, apply the\nmodifier to the numerical value of the trait.\nIf the model does not have the specified\ntrait, it first gains the trait at value 0 and\nthen applies the modifier to the newly\nadded trait. Effects which grant a Trait (+X)\nstack, you add all these values together .\nRange values can also be modified in the\nsame way . If a trait has a negative X value,\nthis is always a modifier, not a fixed value .\nThese stack, just like +X values.\nExample: Kuma has Armour (1). If he gains\nArmour (2) from a nearby Kami of Eternal\nEarth then he will use the new trait, they are\nnot cumulative. Kuma now has Armour (2)\nExample: The Nightmares of Jigoku\ntheme inflicts Spirit (-1). This gives -1 to\nany Spirit value. If the target does not\nalready have Spirit it gains Spirit (0)\nthen the -1 modifier, to give it Spirit (-1).\nExample: Naoko of the Ito Clan does not\nhave the Armour trait, but uses Mutation\nto gain Armour (+1). She first gains Armour\n(0) and then applies the +1 modifier, giving\nher Armour (1). If a model had Armour (1)\nalready and gained Armour (+1), it would\nnow have Armour (2).\nTraits\nA\nAdept [Descriptor](X): When rolling\n[Descriptor] Tests this model may\nkeep up to X additional supporting\ndice, beyond the normal 2 . These also\nadd +1 to the highest dice value when\ncalculating the final result .\nAggressive: This model must allocate\nat least as many dice to Attack as to\nDefence during Melee Exchanges .\nIf a model has both Aggressive and\nDefensive traits, the effects of both\nare cancelled .\nAgile: When this model activates\nit may ignore Enemy models in BtB\nwhen declaring its action . This model\nmay move out of BtB with Enemy\nmodels without the need to perform a\nDisengage action. If this model does not\ndeclare a Disengage action, Stand Up\naction, melee useable Ki Feat, or Melee\naction, it must move out of BtB with any\nEnemy models currently in BtB .\nThis model also has Immune [Held] .\nAloof: This model may not perform\nScenario Actions .\n61\nAmmo (X): This model starts the\ngame with X Ammo tokens .

If the player chooses not to use\nFlank, this model is Deployed as normal .\nIf the player decides the model is using\nFlank, then the model is left Elsewhere\nand instead before the game the\nowning player makes a note of which\nturn the Flanking models will arrive\nand notes a neutral table edge: This is\nHidden Information . This must be turn\n2,3 or 4 . In the starting phase of that\nturn reveal the number and deploy the\nmodels anywhere along the chosen\nedge but not in the Opponent’s\nDeployment Zone .\nIf a model gains Flank mid game or is\nremoved and returns to play using the\nflank rules, you immediately note any\nturn after the current turn (not just 2,3\nor 4) and a neutral edge for that model\nwhen it is removed from play . This is\nHidden Information . Flanking models\ngenerate two Activation Counters when\nthey are Deployed .\nFortune: During Ki Generation, this\nmodel’s controller may flip a coin\nand call heads or tails .

During a melee\nexchange, this model will lose the\ninitiative if it is the active model . If\nthis model has Lightning Reflexes, a\nweapon with the Reach trait or both\nthen it ignores those traits and Slow for\nthe duration of the melee exchange .\nSoulless: This model automatically\nsucceeds at Fear tests and has Immune\n[Bleed, Frightened, Poison] . This\nmodel also automatically succeeds at\nOpposed Ki Tests when it is not the\nActive mode .\nSpirit (X): This model modifies its Ki\nStatistic by X when resolving Ki tests\nor when attempting to Target or move\ninto BtB with a Disguised model .

While\nFrightened this model may still declare\nactions against and enter BtB with\nmodels with Fear .\nTraits\nExample: Kenko has Split Attack. If he moves\ninto melee with 2 models and performs a\nmelee exchange against both, he takes a\n-1 dice penalty on both exchanges as he is\nmaking one additional exchange. Next turn a\nthird enemy model moves into BtB with Kenko.\nIf Kenko makes a split attack against all three\nmodels, he will take a -2 Dice penalty on all\nthree melee exchanges.\n72\nStrategy [Bonus]: Whenever you win\nthe Tactical Roll, this model gains the\nbracketed bonus .\nStrong: This model makes Size tests at +1\nDice . When this model makes a Damage\nRoll, roll 3D6 and choose the two highest\ndice.

Strong [Melee] .\nStupid: This model cannot declare\nWait, Disengage, Scenario or any\nComplex Actions .\nSwarm: This model has a -1 dice penalty\non size tests. Ranged attacks targeting\nthis model suffer an additional +1 to\nthe Challenge Number .\nT\nTactician (X): This model adds X dice\nwhen it performs Tactical Tests .\nTerror: If a model makes a Fear test\ncaused by this model it must re-roll\nthe test if it succeeds . Models must\nonly re-roll the same test once due to\nthis trait . If a model with the Bravery\ntrait makes a Fear test caused by this\nmodel the effects of both traits are\ncancelled .\nTiny: This model is Tiny sized . Models\nTargeting this model with a Ranged\nAttack add a +1 modifier to the\nChallenge Number of the test . This\nmodel rolls one dice for Size Tests .\nTireless: This model does not remove an\nactivation counter as a result of Melee\nExchanges initiated by Enemy models .\nTough (X): When this model would\nsuffer Wounds from any source reduce\nthe final number of Wounds by X (If X\nis negative, instead you will increase\nthe number of wounds taken) .\nTraits\n73\nU\nUnblockable (X): During this model’s\nMelee Exchanges the Enemy model\nmust remove its X highest Defence\ndice rolled before the final Defence\nresult is calculated .\nUnstable: This model treats each inch\nmoved in Difficult Terrain elements as\n4” rather than 2”. If a model with this\ntrait gains the Lightfooted Trait, it\ncounts as having neither trait .\nV\nVengeance [Descriptor]: This model’s\nmelee weapons gain Brutal (+1) and +1\nMelee Strength when resolving a melee\nexchange against a [Descriptor] Model.\nVirtue (X”): Once per turn during\nthis model’s activation, it may give a\ntarget friendly Faction, non-Soulless,\nnon-Insignificant model within X”\na Virtue Token . A model may only\nhave one Virtue Token at any time .\nA model may spend a Virtue Token\nat any time it could use an Instant\nKi Feat .The benefits of spending the\nToken depend on the models in play .\nSee Virtue (p .10) A model may benefit\nfrom only one Virtue bonus per Token\nunless otherwise stated .\nW\nWeak: This model makes Size Tests\nat -1 Dice . When this model makes a\nDamage Roll, roll 3D6 and choose the\ntwo lowest dice . If a model has both\nStrong and Weak traits, the effects of\nboth are cancelled .\nWillpower (X): This model modifies\nthe result by X when calculating its\nfinal result in Opposed Ki tests when it\nis the Activating model .\nTraits\n74\nTerrain elements are categorised by three traits: Passage, Visibility and Size . When\nTerrain is described, these are listed as [Passage, Visibility, Size] .\nPASSAGE\nHow easy is it for a model to move\nthrough?\nImpassable: Cannot be moved through.\nDifficult: Can be moved through but\neach inch counts as 2 inches moved\nfor any movement whilst within the\nTerrain element for models making\na Walk, Melee, Run, or Charge . If\nEnhancing terrain has a sheer drop,\nthis is usually Difficult terrain and\nbeing pushed, Slammed or Thrown\nfrom that Huge Enhancing terrain\nleaves a model Prone and after any\ndamage roll the damage is not halved .\nNormal: No effect to movement .\nIdeal: Ideal terrain, such as adequately\npaved roads or the like can aid in\nmovement . While making walk, run or\ncharges if it crosses the Ideal Terrain\nat any point then it can add an extra 2”\nto its total move distance . We suggest\nIdeal terrain only apply to individual\nterrain items . If you play on a board with\npaving marked all over it, do not count the\nwhole table as ideal!\nPlayers should decide before the game\nstarts if any areas of a Terrain element\nare different .\nVISIBILITY\nCan the Terrain element be seen\nthrough when drawing Line of Sight?\nClear: No effect on LoS .\nBlocking: No LoS can be drawn\nthrough any part of the Terrain\nelement that is considered Blocking .\nIf any Los is blocked to the target\nby Blocking terrain (Assuming there\nis a clear LoS past the terrain) then\nthe target benefits from Cover if it is\nwithin 1” of the terrain piece .\nObscuring: If any Line of Sight to\nany part of a target’s base is drawn\nthrough Obscuring terrain, then the\ntarget benefits from cover if it is within\n1” of the terrain piece .\nEnhancing: Models on hilly terrain or\notherwise elevated gain Reach on their\nMelee Weapons for melee exchanges\nwhere a non-Cloudwalk opponent did\nnot begin it’s activation on the same\nterrain as they hold the high ground .\nIn addition, they ignore models and\nterrain smaller than the Enhancing\nterrain for LoS (Though such terrain\ncan still provide cover if a LoS passes\nthrough them) .\nTERRAIN\nTerrain\n75Terrain\nSIZE\nA terrain element’s size is what is\nphysically represented on the table\n- but should be agreed upon by both\nplayers before the start of the game\nif either player considers it likely that\nthe Size of a particular piece of terrain\nmight be unclear .\nIf players cannot agree on the size of\na terrain element, by default the Size\nof a piece of terrain (As with models,\nTiny, Small, Medium, Large or Huge) to\nbe the Size of the smallest base it can\nfit on . If it is too big for a 50mm base,\nit is Huge .Some Clear terrain has no\nSize (Water for example) and is listed\nas Size Zero . Given this definitive test,\nit should be possible to define the Size\nof a piece of terrain during the game,\nas and when it becomes relevant to\ngameplay. This does not work for some\nelements, e .g . walls, so it is only to\ndecide when players cannot agree on\nodd items of terrain . In a Tournament\nsituation, ask the organiser .\nFor Blocking terrain pieces (see\nVisibility above) where it is intended\nthat LOS can be drawn over them,\nthen these should be classified as Tiny,\nsuch that it is possible to gain Cover,\nbut LOS is not blocked .\nThese rules are designed to allow you\nto use these traits to represent any\nterrain collection .Walls, for example,\ncan vary in height depending on how\nthey have been modeled .\nA wall could be anywhere from a knee-\nhigh garden wall [Difficult, Blocking,\nTiny] up to a formidable city wall\n[Difficult, Blocking, Huge] .\nIf your bamboo forests are thick\nwith bamboo you could make them\n[Impassable, Blocking] rather than the\nmore sparse [Difficult, Obscuring] .\nDiscuss the terrain with your opponent\nor have a good selection available\nso you can both choose fun and\nentertaining pieces for set up\nWe would recommend that before a\ngame starts, each player highlights\nany terrain pieces where they consider\nthe size classification may not be\ntotally clear, in particular, whether a\nterrain piece might be either Tiny or\nSmall, or Large or Huge, and discuss\nand agree on this with their opponent .\nRemember the rules are made to\nbe definitive . A simple check with a\ngaming laser should solve all cover\nand LoS issues and while they may\nnot always make sense, based on how\nthe model looks from a “Model’s Eye\nView”, remember that the static model\nis representing a soldier who may be\nactively trying to hug terrain or keep a\nlow profile .\nEXAMPLE TERRAIN PIECES\nPond [Difficult, Clear, Zero]\nPaved Road [Ideal, Clear, Zero]\nLow Hedge [Difficult, Blocking, Tiny]\nWall [Impassable, Blocking, Small]\nStatue [Impassable, Blocking, Medium]\nLone Tree [Impassable, Blocking, Large]\nHill [Normal, Enhancing, Large]\nBamboo Forest [Difficult, Obscuring, Huge]\nHouse [Impassable, Blocking, Huge]\nFog [Normal, Obscuring, Huge]\n76\nSome Terrain is bought as a Special\nCard, and these terrain types are either\ncards deployed on the table, or on a\nstated base size . They have Visibility\nand Passage traits like all terrain and\nusually have other rules and can even\nhave model traits .\nTERRAIN SET UP\nA good table set up has at least 5-6\npieces of different terrain depending\non the size of the terrain . Lots of\nterrain, each covering a smaller area,\nis better than fewer large pieces .We\nrecommend including at least one of\neach of:\n• [Impassable, Blocking, Huge]\nterrain, such as a boulder or house .\n• [Difficult, Clear, Zero] terrain such\nas water or tilled fields\n• [Difficult, Obscuring, Large] such\nas a bamboo forest\nThen add other items .\nImpassable Terrain cannot be deployed\nwithin 2” of Scenario Objectives or\nother impassable terrain .Try to avoid\nplacing it in the area of a scenario or\ndeployment zone . Terrain should be 2”\nfrom the edge of the table, but if you\nhave very large items of terrain, these\ncan often be best used by placing them\nhalf on the table rather than occupying\nmost of the play area with them .\nOther terrain can be set up as you wish\nbut not in contact with other terrain\nor overlapping .The terrain should be\nequally spread around the table .\nTerrain\n77Scenario Rules\nBushido is best enjoyed by playing a Scenario . Whilst beating your opponent into\nthe ground until the last man is standing is fun, especially when learning the rules,\nthere will come a time when you want to explore the full strategically challenging\npotential that Bushido has to offer .\nTYPE\nAll Scenarios have a Type: Scenario\nObjectives or Zone Control . Types\nare linked to the scoring of Victory\nPoints (VP’s) in Scenarios, how this is\nachieved is dependent on the Scenario\nand explained under its Victory\nConditions .\nSCENARIO OBJECTIVES\nThese are terrain elements on the\nbattlefield that players must attempt\nto interact with . Scenario Objectives\nare one of three Alignments (Friendly,\nNeutral or Enemy) this can be\nshown on the board by turning\nthe Scenario Objective to face the\nplayer’s Deployment Zone to whom\nit is Friendly or neither showing it\nis Neutral . If a Scenario Objective is\nFriendly to a player, then his Opponent\nconsiders it Enemy .\nIn Scenarios, players can use their\nmodels to interact with Scenario\nObjectives through Scenario actions .\nThe effect is detailed under Scenario\nObjective Interactions . All Scenario\nObjectives are considered Blocking\nand Impassable Terrain elements\nunless specified in the Scenario .\nSCENARIO OBJECTIVE\nINTERACTIONS\nPlayers can interact with Scenario\nObjectives by taking Simple or\nComplex Scenario actions (See\nActions) . The action needed, Simple\nor Complex, will be in brackets after\nthe Scenario Objective Interaction .\nFor example: Influence (Simple) . The\neffect of an action depends on the\nScenario Objective Interaction of the\nScenario .\nIf there is more than one Interaction\navailable to the model, then the\ncontrolling player decides which to\nuse .Only those Interactions outlined\nin a Scenario can be used . The\nInteractions will appear as Keywords\nand are as follows:\nInfluence (Simple/Complex): The\nplayer changes the Alignment of\na Scenario Objective one Degree\n(Enemy - Neutral - Friendly) .\nSCENARIO RULES\n78\nPrayer (X) (Simple/Complex): Each\nplayer starts the game with X Prayer\nTokens . These are placed in a Prayer\nPool for each player . The player\nremoves one Prayer Token from their\nPrayer Pool and scores Scenario Points\n(SP’s) . The number of SP’s scored\ndepends on the Alignment of the\nScenario Objective the model is in BtB\nwith .\nFriendly = 1 Scenario Point\nNeutral = 2 Scenario Points\nEnemy = 3 Scenario Points\nA model may only declare a Scenario\naction once per Objective in any Turn .\nWorship (Simple/Complex): The\nController of the model that performs\nthis Scenario Objective Interaction\nplaces a Worship marker next to the\nScenario Objective in BtB with the\nmodel . If the Scenario Objective’s\nAlignment would be reset instead\nremove a Worship marker .\nSome Scenarios will have additional\nrules denoted by the following\nKeywords and their rules are detailed\nas follows:\nDecreasing (Popular): During the\nEnd Phase of a Turn after scoring VP’s\nremove a Scenario Objective on which\nmost Simple Scenario actions were\ntaken . In the event of a tied number of\nSimple Scenario actions on Scenario\nObjectives, the scoring player’s\nOpponent decides which to remove .\nDecreasing (Scorer): During the End\nPhase of a Turn after scoring VP’s\nremove a Scenario Objective which\nis Friendly to the player who scored\nthe VP . The scoring player’s Opponent\ndecides which to remove if there is\nmore than one available .\nReset (X/X): During the Starting\nPhase of Turns X and X reset each\nplayer’s Scenario Points total to 0 .\nReset Influence (X/X): During the\nStarting Phase of Turns X and X\nreset the Alignment of all Scenario\nObjectives to Neutral .\nZONE CONTROL\nIn these scenarios, there are areas on\nthe board that the players must battle\nto Control . A player Controls a Zone if\nthey have a higher Rice Cost of models\nentirely within the Zone’s area and\nhave more models completely within\nthe Zone’s area than their Opponent .\nA player gains a number of Scenario\nPoints equal to the Alignment of\nthe Zone during the End Phase .\nFriendly = 1 SP\nNeutral = 2 SP\nEnemy = 3 SP\nScenario Rules\n79Scenario Rules\nDEPLOYMENT\nThis section outlines the deployment of the players’ models and if necessary any\nScenario Objectives . For models, Deployment can be either Baseline or Corner\nSquare Deployment . This is the area that the players will deploy their models .\nIf the Scenario uses Scenario Objectives,\nthen players should place them on the\nboard as instructed under this section of\nthe Scenario explanation in conjunction\nwith the Scenario’s diagram .Objectives\nwith the same colour as your deployment\nzone are Friendly . Uncoloured Objectives\nare Neutral .\nThe Scenario Objective’s base size will\nappear in brackets . There are three\ndifferent base sizes: Small, Medium\nand Large .\nIf you can’t deploy all of your models due\nto insufficient space, you are permitted\nto remove any impassable terrain that\nrestricts your deployment space .\n6”\n6”\nBaseline Deployment: Models are\nset up with the base of the model\ntouching the edge of the board .\nCorner Square Deployment: Players\nset up their models completely within\na 6” square in opposite corners of the\nboard .\nIf you find you still cannot fit all\nmodels that need to be deployed in\nthe deployment zone, models not\ndeployed are removed from play .\n80\nGAME LENGTH\nThe length of a game of Bushido can be\nFixed or Variable and lasts a number of\nTurns detailed below . The game ends in\nthe End Phase of the last turn or in the End\nPhase after one player has no models left\nin play. If either player has no models left in\nplay, calculate Scenario Points and Victory\nPoints, and then determine the final score .\nOnce this is done, the game ends.\nVariable (X): During the Starting\nPhase of Turn (X) one of the players\nrolls a single D6 . If the result is 4 or\nmore, the game will finish at the end\nof the Turn, If not then the game\ncontinues to the next Turn when this\nroll will be made again . The game will\nalways finish after the End Phase of\nthe seventh Turn .\nFixed (X): The game finishes after the\nEnd Phase of the designated Turn (X) .\nVICTORY CONDITIONS\nEach Scenario has three Victory Points\n(VP’s) available to the players . At the\nend of the game, the player who has\nscored the highest number of VP’s is\nthe winner . If both players have scored\nan equal number of VP’s, then the game\nis a draw . Only 3 VPs can be scored in\nany scenario, so both players VP scores\ncombined will always be three or less .\nScenario Rules\n81\nThe remaining leagues have been\nnothing but a blanket of emerald rice\npaddies and dusty dykes crisscrossing\nthe land . You have been greeted by\nthe lowing of half-submerged water\nbuffalo and the friendly chatter of\nwrinkled farmers on your way to the\ngrove . At the edge of freshly ploughed\nfields, swaying palm trees mark the\nvillages and waterholes, while a\nconstant blue haze in the distance,\npoints to where the mountains are .\nThe evenings are an explosion of\nfireflies, sparks, and stars while the\ndawn wraps you in ghostly mist and\nscatters a billion diamonds at your\nweary feet . After a few more days you\nfind what you have been looking for .\nThe power here is palpable, it makes\nyour skin prickle and your hairs rise, and\nit smells like the air during a lightning\nstorm . Before you, in the middle of the\nglade, are six stone lanterns laid out in\na circle . Some are crooked and broken,\nbut all are wrapped in vines and moss\nand rise from the ground like the bones\nof a hastily buried corpse . The forest is\nsilent, too silent .From the other side\nof the glade comes the unmistakable\nsound of a dry branch snapping under\na misplaced footstep . It seems you’re\nnot alone .From out of the trees and\nbushes come the distinct silhouettes\nof your mortal enemies readying\nthemselves for the fight .\nTYPE:\nScenario Objective\nDEPLOYMENT:\nBaseline Deployment\n6 Scenario Objectives (Small)\n2 Friendly, 2 Neutral and 2 Enemy\nGAME LENGTH:\nFixed (6)\nSCENARIO OBJECTIVE\nINTERACTION:\nPrayer (5) (Simple)\nVICTORY CONDITIONS:\n1 VP To the player with most Scenario\nPoints at the end of Turn 2 .\n1 VP To the player with most Scenario\nPoints at the end of Turn 4 .\n1 VP To the player with most Scenario\nPoints at the end of Turn 6 .\nReset (3,5)\nKeii\nKEII\n6”\n6”\n12”\n8”\n82\nTYPE:\nZone Control\nDEPLOYMENT:\nBaseline Deployment\n3 Zones 4” diameter all Neutral\nGAME LENGTH:\nFixed (6)\nSCENARIO OBJECTIVE\nINTERACTION:\nN/A\nVICTORY CONDITIONS:\n1VP To the player who has the most\nscenario points at the end of turn 2 .\n1VP To the player who has the most\nscenario points at the end of turn 4 .\n1VP To the player who has the most\nscenario points at the end of turn 6 .\nReset (2,4,6)\nYour heart beats wildly as the sweat\nstings your eyes .
